#Volunteer at Mekor

###*Kiddush*

We are famous for our wonderful *kiddush* every Shabbat, but it doesn’t happen by itself. Thanks to individual members of our community and especially our [Sisterhood]({{site.url}}/social/sisterhood.html) led by Alex Hochster, we enjoy an amazing *kiddush* week after week. 

Making *kiddush* happen is not simple, but it becomes significantly easier when there are helping hands. Please, consider signing up to help once or twice every couple of months. You can help set up the *kiddush* or take it down. Please contact [Alex Hochster](mailto:kiddush@mekorhabracha.org) to volunteer.

###Torah and *Haftarah* Reading

In order to provide the community with quality Torah and *haftarah* reading, we need capable people from the community to provide this invaluable service. If you know how to read Torah or *haftarah*, and would like to volunteer to *lain*, please [send us an email](mailto:laining@mekorhabracha.org) for more information. We would love to hear some new voices! 

If you are a little rusty or do not know how to read Torah and would like to learn, please [reach out to Jonathan Newcombe](mailto:jfnewcombe@gmail.com).

###Life Events Meals Program and Shabbat Hospitality

Our life events meals program, led by Emily Dubitsky, helps families who recently had a baby or have undergone a significant life event. If you are in that situation and you would like to participate in this wonderful program, please [send the program an email](mailto:lifeevents@mekorhabracha.org).

If you want to contribute with meals for the life events meals program or help with hospitality, please [sign up for the *shul*’s hospitality email list](mailto:hospitality@mekorhabracha.org). Those on the list will receive hospitality requests made to the *shul* and meal preparation and other requests to help families after a life event.

###Become an *Eruv* Checker or a *Mashgiach*

The community is in need of *eruv* checkers and *mashgichim* for local food establishments. If you could help for about one hour on a Thursday or Friday every 2–3 months for the eruv, or are available to be a *mashgiach* please [contact the *shul*](mailto:info@mekorhabracha.org).

###Center City *Mikvah* Project

The Mekor Habracha Center City *Mikvah* committee, led by recently appointed *Mikvah* President and Mekor member Yah-el Har-el, is working hard to get the project started. Mekor Habracha has been at the forefront of these efforts, raising a serious amount of money from within our community and taking leadership roles upon themselves. 

The *Mikvah* project still needs volunteers to help with the building stage, so please [send us an email](mailto:info@mekorhabracha.org) if you would like to volunteer for this vital community effort.
