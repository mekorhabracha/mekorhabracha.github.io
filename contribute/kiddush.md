#Sponsor Kiddush

The cost of a standard kiddush is $150 for Mekor members and $200 for non-members. This typically includes Entenmann's-type cakes and cookies, potato chips, crackers and hummus, herring, and drinks. By request, this may also include a celebratory fresh bakery birthday style cake with writing. We will be happy to accommodate any other special requests --- just [let us know](mailto:kiddush@mekorhabracha.org).

###Add-ons

For an additional contribution you can add any of the following to the standard kiddush:

- Fresh bakery cakes, cookies and pastries **($225)**
- Bagels and spreads (white fish salad, tuna, lox spread, cream cheese) **($325)** (request by 10am the Wednesday prior to the sponsored Shabbat)
- Cheese platter with fancy cheeses and crackers **(small $150, large $225)** (please request in advance)
- Fruit platter **(small $100, large $150)**
- Vegetable platter **(small $100, large $150)**

Mekor Habracha members have a $25 cost discount over each of these items.

Please be aware that we deliberately keep kiddush costs low to make sponsorship accessible to as many people as possible, particularly to shul members. One kiddush sponsorship does not cover all of the expenses related to kiddush, which include all food, utensils, napkins, cups, tablecloths, grape juice, shot glass cups, coffee, tea, sweeteners, etc, as well as the cleaning service after Shabbat. We therefore allow multiple sponsorships on any given Shabbat to help cover these costs, as well as to deflect the cost of kiddush for Shabbatot that do not have a kiddush sponsor. 

If you choose one of the "add-ons", we will announce that it is being served thanks to your sponsorship. 

If there are food items that you would like to add that are not on the list, please let us know and we will inform you of the availability and cost.
