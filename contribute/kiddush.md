Sponsoring kiddush is a wonderful way to honor or remember friends and family, as well as to commemorate life cycle events.  If you would like to sponsor kiddush, please email the shul at mekorhabracha@gmail.com.

The cost of a standard kiddush is $175 for Mekor members and $200 for non-members. This typically includes cholent, sweet and savory snacks, and drinks. By request, this may also include a celebratory cake.

All special requests, including add-ons and cakes, must be made by Monday at noon prior to the Shabbat being sponsored.

Please be aware that we deliberately keep kiddush costs low to make sponsorship accessible to the whole community. We welcome multiple sponsorships on any given Shabbat or Yom Tov.

We will be happy to accommodate any special requests --- just email the shul at mekorhabracha@gmail.com and we will inform you of the availability and cost.
