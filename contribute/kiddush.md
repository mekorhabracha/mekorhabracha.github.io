#Sponsor Kiddush

Sponsoring kiddush is a great way to honor or remember friends and family, as well as to commemorate life cycle events.

The cost of a standard kiddush is $150 for Mekor members and $200 for non-members. This typically includes cholent, sweet and savory snacks, and drinks. By request, this may also include a celebratory cake.

###Add-ons

For an additional contribution you can add any of the following to the standard kiddush:

- Fresh bakery cakes, cookies and pastries **($225)**
- Bagels and spreads (white fish salad, tuna, lox spread, cream cheese) **($325)**
- Cheese platter with fancy cheeses and crackers **(small $150, large $225)**
- Fruit platter **(small $100, large $150)**
- Vegetable platter **(small $100, large $150)**

Mekor Habracha members have a $25 cost discount over each of these items.

All special requests, including add-ons and cakes, must be made by the Wednesday morning prior to the Shabbat being sponsored.

Please be aware that we deliberately keep kiddush costs low to make sponsorship accessible to the whole community. We welcome multiple sponsorships on any given Shabbat or Yom Tov.

We will be happy to accommodate any other special requests --- just [let us know](mailto:kiddush@mekorhabracha.org) and we will inform you of the availability and cost.

###Seudah shlishit

Third Meal sponsorship is $50 for Mekor members and $75 for non-members.
