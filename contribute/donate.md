Your donation is greatly needed and appreciated! Tax-deductible donations to sponsor a kiddush, dedicate a prayer book, chumash or other religious item, or to support our synagogue are wonderful ways to honor family, friends, or the memory of a departed loved one.

All contributions are fully tax-deductible and will be acknowledged in a letter that may be used for tax purposes.
