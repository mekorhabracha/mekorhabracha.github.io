Your donation is greatly needed and appreciated! Tax-deductible donations to sponsor a kiddush, dedicate a prayer book, chumash or other religious item, or to support our synagogue are wonderful ways to honor family, friends, or the memory of a departed loved one. 

You can take a look at our [current dedication opportunities]({{site.url}}/contribute/dedicate.html) or pay a visit to our [wall of dedications]({{site.url}}/about/dedications.html).

All contributions are fully tax-deductible and will be acknowledged in a letter that may be used for tax purposes.
