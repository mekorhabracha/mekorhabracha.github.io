        <title>Music, Bonfire Light Up Kensington for Lag B’Omer</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Jewish Exponent mentioned Mekor’s own band, Moments of Wrong, in its account of this year’s Lag b’Omer festival:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It was finally starting to feel like summer, with temperatures rising into the 90s last week. But it got even hotter on May 26 at Fifth Street and Cecil B. Moore Avenue after the fire marshal arrived and the bonfire could finally be lit.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Mystic Music Festival, co-sponsored by The Chevra and the Jewish Center of Northern Liberties, brought live music, food and drink and a seriously diverse crowd to a vast vacant lot in Kensington for a celebration of Lag B’Omer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In case you’re not familiar with Lag B’Omer, which isn’t one of Judaism’s major holidays, here’s a brief primer: It’s an agriculturally based observance that derives from biblical law, which proscribes that an omer — an ancient Hebrew measure of grain — must be offered at the Temple in Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Leviticus reads: “And from the day on which you bring the offering … you shall count off seven weeks. They must be complete.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;For our agrarian ancestors, that seven-week span was customarily a somber time reserved for praying for good weather for the harvest. Today, it’s still a period of cultural restraint: festive gatherings, weddings and even haircuts are prohibited.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;There is one exception, though, and that’s the 33rd day of the Omer, aka Lag B’Omer. On this day, dancing, music and parties are encouraged. People get married. Kids play with bows and arrows. There are picnics and field trips. And there are bonfires everywhere — even in Kensington.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Though the Jewish Center of Northern Liberties had been throwing this Lag B’Omer party for 11 years, this was the first time it held the event at this location, a fenced expanse of grass and dirt surrounded by evidence of Philadelphia’s industrial past — and of its vibrant, ever-changing present.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The remains of the old Gretz Brewery, with its iconic smokestack, loom over the lot; directly across the street, a former factory has been converted to loft apartments. Down the street, a craft brewery named for Ben Franklin has taken up residence in the former carriage house and stables of the defunct Theo Finkenauer Brewery. Other old buildings stand in limbo, no longer needed for the Workshop of the World, but not adapted for current use.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The intersection of Fifth and Cecil B. Moore is also notable for its painted concrete canvases. Several walls here are permission walls, meaning the property owners allow and encourage the artwork — and have done so since the 1980s. As a result, the corner is alive with constantly changing, brightly colored images that bring photographers and artists from all over.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A building-length mural of late Latino rapper Big Pun runs along North Fifth Street. It almost seemed as if he was watching, perhaps with some puzzlement, as the Lag B’Omer celebrants queued up for hotdogs and wings.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Rabbi Gedaliah Lowenstein, co-director of the Chabad-affiliated Jewish Center of Northern Liberties, chatted amiably beneath Big Pun’s gaze as he slathered sunscreen on his skin. He said the center started the Lag B’Omer festival when it was looking for a signature event. The minor holiday was the perfect fit.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“It’s fun,” said Lowenstein, “and no one else does it.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The first year they got about 150 people out to the festival, but it’s become much more popular since then.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“The highest year we got about a thousand people,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;On May 26, the lot quickly filled up with people of all stripes, including Fairmount resident Amanda Leslie and Brewerytown’s Lucy deWahl. Leslie came to support her boyfriend, who was in one of the seven bands playing at the event.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“We’re probably not a good representation [of this crowd],” she said. “I’m Jewish, but I’m not observant. And this is my gentile friend,” she said, gesturing to deWahl, who smiled broadly.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But Leslie and deWahl were actually perfectly representative of a crowd that couldn’t be easily defined. Like the neighborhood itself, the mix of people was diverse: There were families with children, young hipsters with beards and tattoos, men wearing yarmulkes and tzitzit, people speaking different languages.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Neither Leslie nor deWahl had ever heard of Lag B’Omer, but that wasn’t a deterrent.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“This is a fun, weird thing to do on a Thursday night. It’s an interesting use of the space,” Leslie said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As the band Moments of Wrong played a song by the Talking Heads&lt;/strong&gt;, Derek Greeley and wife Courtney, who live in Moorestown, N.J., got comfortable in their camp chairs. Greeley, the director of youth engagement at the Reform Temple Adath Emanu-El in Mt. Laurel, N.J., would normally be busy with his youth group, Aefty, on a weekday afternoon. But Thursday he had off, so he and Courtney drove into the city.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“I try to celebrate Lag B’Omer when I get the opportunity,” he said. “And I’m fortunate this year to have that opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A band named Shoresh played roots-rock tunes about rebbes, shofars and davening as the fire got larger. Parents were warned to keep their children away from the bonfire’s perimeter or the fire marshal would shut it down.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Lowenstein said it took a long time to get permits for the event — one of which, because of the bonfire, is a “permit to pollute.” But all the waiting seemed to be worth it on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Perhaps it was the beginning of a new tradition for Philadelphia’s Olde Kensington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Kohelet Shabbaton Series Wrap-up</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last Shabbat with Rabbi Saul Berman was a once in a lifetime experience, and we were so fortunate to have him in our midst! He gave 3 thought-provoking lectures during our Shabbaton, and a bonus lecture at third meal. We are grateful to the Kohelet Foundation for co-sponsoring our Scholar-in-Residence series, and to Julia Rafsky for securing the Kohelet grant &amp;amp; organizing the three wonderful Shabbatons. A huge thank you to all the volunteers who helped make this possible, and to Daniel Shimansky for his beautiful davening. We look forward to many more inspiring events with our wonderful community!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Waxman and Snyder to Challenge Sims for the 182nd District</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Incumbent Democrat Brian Sims is facing competition this year in the 182nd District from three challengers, including Jewish newcomers Marni Snyder and Ben Waxman.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The other Democratic candidate is Louis Lanni, who has run as a Republican in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The primary election is April 26, with the general election slated for Nov. 8.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The 182nd District covers Center City and parts of South Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Here’s some background on Snyder and Waxman.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4 id=&quot;ben-waxman&quot;&gt;Ben Waxman&lt;/h4&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;While Waxman is only 31, he is motivated and ambitious.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;He was involved with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) during high school, leading protests against the Iraq war and the Patriot Act. He also served on its board and later as youth organizer for an anti-death penalty group called Pennsylvania Abolitionists United Against the Death Penalty.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“I’m a big believer of doing the job right,” Waxman said. “If you work really hard, other opportunities will come. An injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;He participates in local civic activism, serving on the board of the Center City Residents Association, Friends of  Greenfield and was elected in 2014 to the 8th Ward Democratic Executive Committee.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Waxman credits much of his success to his Jewish background and beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“The primary value is that we in the Jewish community have this idea about tikkun olam,” he said. “That has been a guiding principal for me in terms of the work that I’ve done and why.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;He and his wife, Julie Wertheimer, live in Center City and are members of Temple Beth Zion-Beth Israel. While not religious, he enjoys Shabbat, especially in Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Shabbat is “my favorite tradition, and my greatest inspiration as a Jew is to observe Shabbat,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Waxman told the Jewish Exponent his love for politics began at the age of 14 when he met Rabbi George Stern, the director of the Jewish Social Policy Action Network. He worked with Stern on interfaith dialogue and civil liberties shortly after 9/11, where the rabbi helped him foster his thirst for knowledge and giving back.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As time went by, he noticed there was one glaring problem in Philadelphia: poor education. He is appalled at how many schools have no extra-curricular activities, are overcrowded and don’t have nurses or guidance counselors.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“We have a crisis when it comes to public education,” he said. “I view the Pennsylvania House of Representatives as ground zero for that crisis. The first step to fixing the broken school system is to restore the funding that has been cut so that our students have adequate 
resources in the classrooms and can succeed.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;He suggested one way to fund education is to implement taxes on fracking, which Pennsylvania does not do.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Before establishing his candidacy, Waxman consulted with his wife, who works for the city. Part of her job is conducting focus groups for people who have been incarcerated.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;She told him a story about a convict that blew his mind. She met a man who had been locked up for a year and had previously dropped out of high school. In prison, he turned his life around, went back to school and got his General Educational Development (GED) certificate.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;When Wertheimer asked him what made him do this, the answer shocked her.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“It was much easier in prison,” he told her.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“The idea that it’s easier to get a degree in prison really shook me,” Waxman said. “I’m so frustrated with what’s happened to the Philadelphia school district. A lot of people are.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4 id=&quot;marni-snyder&quot;&gt;Marni Snyder&lt;/h4&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Snyder, 34, practices criminal defense and special education law at her own firm, the Law Offices of M. J. Snyder, LLC in Center City. A native of Overbook Park, Snyder has resided in Center City for the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;After law school, Snyder clerked for the Honorable Carolyn Engel Temin in the homicide division of the First Judicial District of Pennsylvania. In 2007, she became an assistant public defender at the Defender Association of Philadelphia under the leadership of Ellen Greenlee.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“I want my representation to really empower Democrats because I want to introduce data-driven decision-making and statewide advocacy,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;She became interested in social justice and community service at a young age.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“I considered being a public defender absolutely a public service,” she said. “You’re not a good public defender or criminal lawyer if you don’t have the pulse on what’s happening in the courts, legislature and the community.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Her work ethic and commitment to help others comes from her parents, Mark and Sharon Snyder. Her mother, who has taught in the Philadelphia school district for 15 years, has felt increasingly less supported by the district, which inspired Snyder to run for office.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“You wonder what kind of culture and lack of resources made her feel that way,” Snyder said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The love of politics stems from her father, who served as a Democratic committee person in the early 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“He kind of taught me you can do it on a small scale or you can do it on a big scale, and every single part of helping people matters,” she said. “Being a Democrat and having those values was important in my house, no matter the role that we took.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Looking ahead to the election, Snyder said education and criminal justice reform are major issues.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;According to Snyder, not only are prisons overcrowded, but they are housing too many non-violent drug offenders. She favors rehabilitation and diversion programs that help drug users, rather than lock them up.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In looking at the failing education system, she said there needs to be a complete evaluation of how the schools operate. She explained that conducting cost-benefit data analysis and keeping track of data might help the future of education.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“We need to determine how to educate our kids,” she stressed. “We need to fund schools, not prisons.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Snyder, whose favorite holiday is Passover, grew up in a Conservative home, but belongs to Mekor Habracha in Center City. She is not Orthodox, but enjoys the vibrant welcoming atmosphere the shul offers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;She has visited Israel three times and believes her Jewish-based commitment to improving the world around her will help her succeed if elected.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“Figuring out the theme that we want to take on to really help change things is going to be social justice,” she said. “It’s going to be the idea that when we have an eye toward what is fair and good, we can create these things without making pockets of hurt.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&amp;gt; As evidenced by the sea change in popular opinion and in watershed events like the Supreme Court’s ruling in favor of same-sex marriages in 2015, being gay in the United States has never been more accepted. 
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt;However, many Orthodox Jews who are members of the LGBTQ community still live in fear of being ostracized by their community if they come out. 
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt;With that in mind, Eshel, the consortium of LGBTQ Jews and their families in the Orthodox community, is holding a conference, “Halacha and Community: Challenges and Approaches,” on Feb. 28, from 8:45 a.m. to 1 p.m. at the National Museum of American Jewish History. 
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt;According to its website, “Eshel’s mission is to create community and acceptance for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Jews and their families in Orthodox communities.”
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt;“The conference is being framed as a need we have to talk about real issues of ensuring that we are inclusive of our various populations, and that this perspective comes from an honest place informed by halacha and not a reaction to ancillary social trends, politics or fears,” said event organizer Saundra Sterling (Sunnie) Epstein, a Jewish educator working with Eshel as an educational consultant.
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt;“Traditional texts will be integrated with foundational values of Jewish practice, and the most critical need we have to protect the dignity and the well-being of every member of our community,” added Epstein, a member of Mekor Habracha in Center City.
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt;Rabbi Steve Greenberg, co-director of Eshel, will be the event’s keynote speaker. Other presenters come from Eshel, the Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance, Judith Creed Homes for Adult Independence, Mekor Habracha and members of the community. 
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt;Greenberg, described as the first openly gay Orthodox rabbi — he publicly came out in an article in the Israeli newspaper Maariv in 1999 — will discuss the challenges of inclusion and how to welcome a gay or transgender person into an Orthodox community. 
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt;According to Greenberg, when he was younger, the average age of those coming out was in the mid to late 20s, but today it is around 16. This poses a much bigger problem to the Orthodox community, he said. Now, he explained, people must deal with it in camps, youth groups and schools. &lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt;“Parents are much more challenged when their kids come out,” he said. “Over the last 20 years, empathy has grown dramatically. I think rabbis tend to be very receptive to people that are gay or lesbian.” 
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt;“This topic is of great importance — we want to ensure that our family and community members who have in the past been relegated to the category of ‘the other’ are fully included and valued in the manner dictated by Jewish teachings and halacha,” Epstein said. “As one rabbi says, ‘We cannot reject and exclude half of our population [women] or 10 percent or more of our population [LGBTQ] or our impaired members or any group. That is not acceptable.’ 
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt;“We will be addressing various challenges of inclusion in the Orthodox Jewish world through the years, including learning needs of all children, inclusion of Jewish adults with various disabilities and limitations, and proper consideration and involvement of women, as well as approaches taken to resolve these past exclusions — though not completely resolved on some levels,” Epstein added. “As we look at these models, we will consider the most recent focus on inclusion and engaging of LGBT Jews in a compassionate and embracing manner.”
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt;Epstein, who taught at the former Akiba Hebrew Academy for more than 20 years, knows firsthand about being gay and Jewish: Her twin daughters Rachie and Talie Lewis are gay. 
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt;She explained to the Jewish Exponent there are members of the LGBTQ community that have a problem with Orthodox Jews and vice versa. 
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt;“These are people that God made the way God made,” Epstein said. “It’s not for you and me to judge or exclude.”
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt;Although more people are coming out and same-sex marriage is legal, it is still a challenge in the Orthodox community, she noted. These aren’t celebrities or people on magazines, but people who can be ostracized from their religion, she said. 
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt;Epstein has always been a staunch supporter of gay rights, but when her daughters came out, it gave her “street cred,” she said. When Rachie Lewis moved to Boston, she found a Jewish community that accepted her. Lewis, a community organizer for the Jewish Community 
Relations Council, thanked her mother for everything she has done and still does for the gay movement and Jews. 
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt;“My family was incredibly wonderful,” she said. “I feel very grateful to” her mother, she exclaimed. 
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt;Lewis added that people were more accepting of her sexuality when they found out she was engaged. 
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt;“It’s easier to respond to, ‘My child is engaged’ than, ‘My child is gay,’ ” she said. Her mother “created a safety net around me.”
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt;Lewis told the Exponent she knows people who have stayed hidden in the Orthodox community, as well as those who have come out and been mistreated. While some people are accepting, the stress of dealing with it can simply become too much, she said. 
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt;“It is much more of a fight,” she said. “I didn’t really want to fight. In Philadelphia, my mom is doing the fighting for me. I kind of feel like she is the braver one.”
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt;However, she does not believe Orthodox Jews dislike gay people. Her viewpoint is that traditional outlooks are difficult to change. 
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt;“I feel like it is indicative of a desire to keep things the way they are,” Lewis said. “If you live in the right place, you don’t have to abide by the big denominations.”&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Baruch Dayan haEmet: Rabbi Yisroel Belsky</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Mekor Habracha mourns the loss of Rabbi Yisroel Belsky zt’l. Harav Belsky zt’l was one of the greatest Torah scholars/authorities of our generation, and significantly, among the most compassionate as well. He was very close to my family and I sought his counsel numerous times, usually in a time of crisis, and he always made himself available for our needs. We will miss him dearly. May his memory be a blessing to the Mekor Habracha community and the Jewish people.&lt;/p&gt;
