&gt; As evidenced by the sea change in popular opinion and in watershed events like the Supreme Court’s ruling in favor of same-sex marriages in 2015, being gay in the United States has never been more accepted. 
&gt; 
&gt;However, many Orthodox Jews who are members of the LGBTQ community still live in fear of being ostracized by their community if they come out. 
&gt; 
&gt;With that in mind, Eshel, the consortium of LGBTQ Jews and their families in the Orthodox community, is holding a conference, “Halacha and Community: Challenges and Approaches,” on Feb. 28, from 8:45 a.m. to 1 p.m. at the National Museum of American Jewish History. 
&gt; 
&gt;According to its website, “Eshel’s mission is to create community and acceptance for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Jews and their families in Orthodox communities.”
&gt; 
&gt;“The conference is being framed as a need we have to talk about real issues of ensuring that we are inclusive of our various populations, and that this perspective comes from an honest place informed by halacha and not a reaction to ancillary social trends, politics or fears,” said event organizer Saundra Sterling (Sunnie) Epstein, a Jewish educator working with Eshel as an educational consultant.
&gt; 
&gt;“Traditional texts will be integrated with foundational values of Jewish practice, and the most critical need we have to protect the dignity and the well-being of every member of our community,” added Epstein, a member of Mekor Habracha in Center City.
&gt; 
&gt;Rabbi Steve Greenberg, co-director of Eshel, will be the event’s keynote speaker. Other presenters come from Eshel, the Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance, Judith Creed Homes for Adult Independence, Mekor Habracha and members of the community. 
&gt; 
&gt;Greenberg, described as the first openly gay Orthodox rabbi — he publicly came out in an article in the Israeli newspaper Maariv in 1999 — will discuss the challenges of inclusion and how to welcome a gay or transgender person into an Orthodox community. 
&gt; 
&gt;According to Greenberg, when he was younger, the average age of those coming out was in the mid to late 20s, but today it is around 16. This poses a much bigger problem to the Orthodox community, he said. Now, he explained, people must deal with it in camps, youth groups and schools. <br />
&gt; 
&gt;“Parents are much more challenged when their kids come out,” he said. “Over the last 20 years, empathy has grown dramatically. I think rabbis tend to be very receptive to people that are gay or lesbian.” 
&gt; 
&gt;“This topic is of great importance — we want to ensure that our family and community members who have in the past been relegated to the category of ‘the other’ are fully included and valued in the manner dictated by Jewish teachings and halacha,” Epstein said. “As one rabbi says, ‘We cannot reject and exclude half of our population [women] or 10 percent or more of our population [LGBTQ] or our impaired members or any group. That is not acceptable.’ 
&gt; 
&gt;“We will be addressing various challenges of inclusion in the Orthodox Jewish world through the years, including learning needs of all children, inclusion of Jewish adults with various disabilities and limitations, and proper consideration and involvement of women, as well as approaches taken to resolve these past exclusions — though not completely resolved on some levels,” Epstein added. “As we look at these models, we will consider the most recent focus on inclusion and engaging of LGBT Jews in a compassionate and embracing manner.”
&gt; 
&gt;Epstein, who taught at the former Akiba Hebrew Academy for more than 20 years, knows firsthand about being gay and Jewish: Her twin daughters Rachie and Talie Lewis are gay. 
&gt; 
&gt;She explained to the Jewish Exponent there are members of the LGBTQ community that have a problem with Orthodox Jews and vice versa. 
&gt; 
&gt;“These are people that God made the way God made,” Epstein said. “It’s not for you and me to judge or exclude.”
&gt; 
&gt;Although more people are coming out and same-sex marriage is legal, it is still a challenge in the Orthodox community, she noted. These aren’t celebrities or people on magazines, but people who can be ostracized from their religion, she said. 
&gt; 
&gt;Epstein has always been a staunch supporter of gay rights, but when her daughters came out, it gave her “street cred,” she said. When Rachie Lewis moved to Boston, she found a Jewish community that accepted her. Lewis, a community organizer for the Jewish Community 
Relations Council, thanked her mother for everything she has done and still does for the gay movement and Jews. 
&gt; 
&gt;“My family was incredibly wonderful,” she said. “I feel very grateful to” her mother, she exclaimed. 
&gt; 
&gt;Lewis added that people were more accepting of her sexuality when they found out she was engaged. 
&gt; 
&gt;“It’s easier to respond to, ‘My child is engaged’ than, ‘My child is gay,’ ” she said. Her mother “created a safety net around me.”
&gt; 
&gt;Lewis told the Exponent she knows people who have stayed hidden in the Orthodox community, as well as those who have come out and been mistreated. While some people are accepting, the stress of dealing with it can simply become too much, she said. 
&gt; 
&gt;“It is much more of a fight,” she said. “I didn’t really want to fight. In Philadelphia, my mom is doing the fighting for me. I kind of feel like she is the braver one.”
&gt; 
&gt;However, she does not believe Orthodox Jews dislike gay people. Her viewpoint is that traditional outlooks are difficult to change. 
&gt; 
&gt;“I feel like it is indicative of a desire to keep things the way they are,” Lewis said. “If you live in the right place, you don’t have to abide by the big denominations.”</p>
