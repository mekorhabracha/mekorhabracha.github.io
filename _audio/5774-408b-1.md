[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xtf2RQw9ei0) is the song by Regesh (Chazzan Abish Brodt) mentioned in the sermon. *Aveilut* (mourning) is the acceptance of life’s difficulties without anger, without explanation and without escapism. It is pure acceptance of God’s will, even if an unhappy acceptance. If you know the meaning of the Hebrew words, it is difficult to be unmoved by this song. “Please God, do not forget about us.”
