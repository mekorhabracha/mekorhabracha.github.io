Over the last decade, our Center City Jewish community has experienced a remarkable rebirth, and now has a fully functioning Eruv, an expanding list of kosher establishments, and daily morning, afternoon and evening minyanim.  
     
To ensure the ongoing vitality of our community, it is essential that we bring the Center City Mikvah Project to fruition. Rabbi Schmidt has dedicated the Vilna Shul for this purpose, which has brought the cost of the project down significantly, and the Center City Mikvah Project team has been working diligently to complete the task. The Mikvah USA organization has contributed their expertise, funding, and other resources to our local efforts. 

Please add your own support to the Mikvah Project in any way that you can, so that our Center City Jewish community continues to flourish.
