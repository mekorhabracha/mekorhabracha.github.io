The following is a letter I received from OneFamily Fund

>Dear Rabbi Hirsch,
>
>I wanted to take this opportunity to thank you and your community for hosting Team OneFamily for Shabbat. We really enjoyed ourselves and everything was perfect. Your community is obviously one that exemplifies the mitzvah of Hachnasat Orchim and we were made to feel like part of the community.
>
>Team OneFamily was started six years ago as an extension of OneFamily. Our goal is to raise money for victims of terror in Israel by participating in endurance races. We have grown so much since then and have begun offering different races to address the needs of our athletes and members. Our weekend is Philadelphia was so amazing we are already planning for next year. We look forward to joining your community again.
>
>Thank you for incorporating OneFamily and our mission into your Dvar Torah on Shabbat. It was especially poignant and relevant considering that at that exact time there were rockets being shot into Israel forcing thousands of Israeli citizens into bomb shelters and into a state of panic and fear.
>
>There are so many things that you helped us with it would be impossible to list them all but I do want to mention that the homemade vegetarian *chulent* was the talk of the team for the rest of the weekend.
>
>Thank you for hosting us and I look forward to a long lasting relationship with Mekor Habracha.
>
>Sincerely,
>
>Rachel Schwartz
