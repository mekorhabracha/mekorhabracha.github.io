Please note: a previous posting may have been perceived as implying that Rabbi Dov Brisman Shlit”a and K”K Young Israel of Elkins Park condone same gender marriages. While Rabbi Brisman Shlit”a and YIEP believe in treating all people with respect and dignity, they are committed to upholding halacha, and therefore their position is not to support same gender marriages.
