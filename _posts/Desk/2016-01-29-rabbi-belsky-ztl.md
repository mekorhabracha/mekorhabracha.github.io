Mekor Habracha mourns the loss of Rabbi Yisroel Belsky zt'l. Harav Belsky zt'l was one of the greatest Torah scholars/authorities of our generation, and significantly, among the most compassionate as well. He was very close to my family and I sought his counsel numerous times, usually in a time of crisis, and he always made himself available for our needs. We will miss him dearly. May his memory be a blessing to the Mekor Habracha community and the Jewish people.
