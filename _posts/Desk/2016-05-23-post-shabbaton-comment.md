Last Shabbat with Rabbi Saul Berman was a once in a lifetime experience, and we were so fortunate to have him in our midst! He gave 3 thought-provoking lectures during our Shabbaton, and a bonus lecture at third meal. We are grateful to the Kohelet Foundation for co-sponsoring our Scholar-in-Residence series, and to Julia Rafsky for securing the Kohelet grant & organizing the three wonderful Shabbatons. A huge thank you to all the volunteers who helped make this possible, and to Daniel Shimansky for his beautiful davening. We look forward to many more inspiring events with our wonderful community!
