This Shabbat, which follows Tisha B’av, is famously called Shabbat
Nachamu, the Shabbat of Consolation, receiving its name from
the first words of the Haftorah, the prophecy of ישעיהו, &quot;Nachamu
Nachamu Ami&quot;, “My nation”, God decries, “be consoled, be
consoled”. The custom, derived from the פסיקתא דרב כהנא, is
that every summer we have 3 Shabbatot of tragedy, תלתא
דפורענותא, followed byשבעה דנחמתא or 7 weeks of consolation,
leading up to Rosh Hashanah.

Many people ask me about משיח during this time of year. What
will it be like during the time of משיח? Will I see my loved ones?
Will Starbucks and Whole Foods continue to operate? And of
course, the age-old question, when is משיח coming already? The
only honest answer I can give to these questions is “I really don’t
know!”, because by design, we are not supposed to know. As we
have frequently discussed, “Malchut” or God’s trait of “Kingship”,
which corresponds to the era of משיח, must emerge
spontaneously. For example, the language of שום תשים עליך מלך
that you shall place a king upon yourselves, is not so much a
commandment as much as a fact that will simply occur naturally.
The emergent era of משיח is therefore inherently unpredictable in
every aspect. Nonetheless, if it makes any difference, I am
extremely confident that it will be a wonderful time for everyone,
and whether we will enjoy the Messianic Era is not something we
need to be concerned about.

Going through this process, year after year, is not easy, and it at
times feels monotonous and uselessly repetitive.  I frequently tell
the now well-known story about the summer camp where the
camp administration wanted to make Tisha B’av vivid, to have
their campers experience the loss we suffered 2,000 years ago.

They asked the kids to build a model of the Temple in Jerusalem,
and the campers poured their heart and soul into this project and
completed it after several weeks of hard work. Then on the night
of Tisha B’Av, a fire was “accidentally” started that burned the
whole thing down. According to staff members I spoke to, the
part of the story that was untold was that some kids were so
distressed, the camp had to bring in mental health professionals
to provide trauma counseling for them.  Is this what we must
come down to, in trying to teach ourselves and our children to
appreciate the loss of our Temple?

I have always believed that the loss of the Beit Hamikdash can be
conveyed without resorting to such desperate measures.  We ALL
experience loss – it is inevitable.  Every single one of us will
eventually experience a devastating loss in our individual lives –
the loss of a relative, the end of a relationship, the loss of a job. 
The list goes on. We don’t need to go back in time 2,000 years to
experience heartbreaking loss.
