Dear Friends,

We write to you with great enthusiasm regarding the future of our community. Over the last two years, our minyan has experienced tremendous growth and welcomed many new participants. This expansion has translated into a vibrant congregation of which we can be proud. The next step of our development is now complete, as we are thrilled to announce that we have just signed a lease on a space to house our synagogue, located at 127 S. 22nd Street, between Walnut and Sansom.

Our new situation is an exciting one, as it opens the possibility of becoming a fully functioning, independent synagogue. On the other hand, simply maintaining our status quo will require a significant increase in the operating budget.

Fundraising efforts have gotten off to a good start, and we are fortunate to have many wonderful individuals working hard to help us achieve our goals. For us to survive and thrive, it is vital that we increase these efforts. While we are pursuing funding sources outside our group (e.g. grants, individual donors), if our project is to be taken seriously, it is also necessary to maximize resources and participation from within the community. Until now we have not had a formal membership policy, but this is a logical place to start as we begin to build for the future.

We are, therefore, requesting that you become a member of our synagogue, Mekor Habracha/Center City Synagogue, by completing the attached form. If you have not yet made a pledge, inclusive of dues, please send the appropriate amount to our treasurer, Ellen B. Geller, 768 North Croskey Street, Philadelphia, PA 19130. You can also pay dues and make contributions online at https://networkforgood.org

If you are unable to pay the requested membership dues at this time, please fill out the application and remit any amount you can afford. If you can donate additional funds beyond the nominal membership fee, we greatly appreciate your generosity.

We look forward to working together to realize our shared vision.
