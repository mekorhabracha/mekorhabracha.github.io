Dear All,

On March 9, I plan to run my first ever race, a 10K (6.2 miles) in Jerusalem.  I will be participating in the annual RabbisCanRun program, held to benefit Kav L’Noar, a special center in Israel for adolescents-at-risk and their families.
This race also holds a personal significance for me -- I hope to crease awareness about the potential benefits of vigorous exercise for individuals suffering from Parkinson’s.  I have already begun training, and I am building endurance to complete the race.  You can learn more about my campaign on my RabbisCanRun page at http://www.run4kavlnoar.org/en/athlete/rabbieliezer-hirsch-1957/, or use the link in our shul newsletter.
 
Please join me in supporting these worthy causes with a suggested donation of $180 (or more) to help me reach my personal goal of raising $5,000 and the program reach their goal of $75,000. Donations of any amount will be graciously accepted and greatly appreciated.  You can donate online at  https://www.run4kavlnoar.org/en/new-donation.php?athlete_race=272 (or use the link in our shul newsletter), or mail your check payable to KLN Foundation to: Meir Kaniel, FBO RabbisCanRun. 174 Rutherford Blvd. Clifton, NJ 07014   (For check donations in Israel please make payable to Kav L’Noar (earmarked RabbisCanRun) and mail to POB 7685, Jerusalem 91071).

Thank you in advance for your support,

Rabbi Eliezer Hirsch
