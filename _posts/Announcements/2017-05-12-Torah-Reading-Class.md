Led by Dr. Yonatan Cohen

Torah is the basis for all that is Judaism, and thus our relationship to Torah should be nuanced and based on intimate and multi-faceted knowledge.  In shul, we read it with trope, which is an ancient and important way of learning Torah This series of classes will introduce you to the logic of this system and is designed for lainers and non-lainers alike. We will learn and practice each new concept so that you become aware of the various layers of laining and become proficient in  reading Torah. Please email the shul to sign up.
