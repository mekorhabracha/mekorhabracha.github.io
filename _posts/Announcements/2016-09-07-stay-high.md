Don't endure yet another High Holiday season without clarity about its significance for your daily life.
After experiencing this enlightening series, you will attend High Holiday services with an understanding and confidence like never before.
We will address refreshingly stark questions such as:

- Why the High Holidays are NOT about God judging us, NOT about determining our fate for the coming year, and NOT about repentance.
- Why Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur are completely different holidays and the amazing single element that connects them.
- Why the High Holidays should be the most exciting time of the year and how they can empower us to fulfill even our most lofty aspirations.

Everyone --- from beginner student to Rabbi --- will benefit greatly and is welcome to attend.
Each class is self contained and, while recommended, it is NOT necessary to attend all four classes.

Suggested donation to Mekor Habracha is $15 per class/$50 for all four classes.
[Email the shul](mekorhabracha@gmail.com) for questions and to sign up.
