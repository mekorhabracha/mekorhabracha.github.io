Please join us for Mekor Habracha's next Shabbat Across the City program, scheduled for Shabbat lunch, February 25. We are calling on GUESTS to please sign up now by sending an email to the Hospitality Committee at mekorhospitality@gmail.com.   Please consider participating in this event, as it is a wonderful to meet people in our community.
Mekor's SATC program is a huge success, and to this end, we would like to remind everyone participating of some things that will make the programming of this event much easier for us:

-If you have specific needs as hosts or guests (for example, if you cannot walk far distances), please indicate those needs in your email.
-If you must sign up with one other person, we need that to be explicit (for example, "Sarah and Rebecca would like to be placed together at the same home"). We will do our best to accommodate your needs.
-Once assignments are sent out they cannot be changed unless there are extenuating circumstances.

Thank you for your participation. We look forward to another successful SATC!
