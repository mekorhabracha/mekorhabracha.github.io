If you are unable to pay the full membership fee or guest rates for any reason, please email mekorhabracha@gmail.com or contact a board member or the rabbi to request a flexible payment plan or reduction.   We never turn away anyone for lack of funds, so please do not hesitate to contact us. All requests will remain confidential.

FOR MORE INFORMATION, or to obtain a membership application, please email mekorhabracha@gmail.com.  You will also find information [here]({{site.url}}/contribute/donate.html) about how to submit your payments.

Please be aware that even with the rate increase, membership only covers a percentage of our budget, and we will still depend on your continued generosity beyond membership dues to cover our costs.

We will continue to make all efforts to help our community flourish, and look forward to an exciting future for us all. Best wishes for a sweet New Year ahead!
