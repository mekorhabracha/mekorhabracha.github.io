We are excited to announce that Mekor has a rare opportunity to obtain a 2nd Sefer Torah.  We are seeking a generous donor willing to contribute $10,000 in order to acquire and prepare a Sefer Torah that we have identified.  If you or someone you know is interested in performing this important mitzvah to help the Mekor community, please contact Rabbi Hirsch or email the shul.
