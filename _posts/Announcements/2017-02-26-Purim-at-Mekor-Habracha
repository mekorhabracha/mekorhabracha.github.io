Community-wide Mishloach Manot Project
Sending food gifts to friends and family (Mishloach Manot) is one of the four Mitzvot performed on Purim. It is a heartfelt way to emphasize Jewish unity, which lies at the core of the Purim holiday, and creates meaningful connections within our own community as well.  
Through Mekor Habracha's unique project, for $180 you can send a gift bag with delicious treats to every member of our community. Every family on the membership list will receive one package, along with a Purim card that lists all the contributors.
All mishloach manot bags will be available for pickup at Mekor Habracha on Saturday night or Sunday morning, March 11-12.  
To place your mishloach manot order, simply email MekorPurim@gmail.com, and indicate if you would like your name to be listed differently from the way it is listed on your membership form.  Also, please indicate if you do NOT wish to receive a mishloach manot package & would instead like the contributions to go to the shul. You will then receive a response via email with electronic payment instructions.  All orders must be placed by Wednesday, March 1st. Should you have any questions please email MekorPurim@gmail.com, or contact the shul.
