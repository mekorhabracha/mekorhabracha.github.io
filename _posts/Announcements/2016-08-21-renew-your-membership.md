After much deliberation, the shul board has decided to raise our membership rates for the Jewish calendar year 5777 (2016/17). While we consistently aspire to keep our dues extremely affordable, the rapid growth of our wonderful community and its expanding needs is a major factor behind this decision.  

You can read more about the new rates in our [membership page]({{site.url}}/about/become-member.html), and you will find more information [here]({{site.url}}/contribute/donate.html) about how to submit your payments.

Please be aware that even with the rate increase, membership only covers a percentage of our budget, and we will still depend on your continued generosity beyond membership dues to cover our costs.

 We will continue to make all efforts to help our community flourish, and look forward to an exciting future for us all. Best wishes for a sweet New Year ahead!
