MEKOR HABRACHA CENTER CITY SYNAGOGUE WELCOMES PHILADELPHIA JEWISH COMMUNITY
TO RING IN 5773

Philadelphia, Pa.—Mekor Habracha Center City Synagogue invites the Philadelphia Jewish community to begin the Jewish Year 5773 in a warm, friendly community at its annual High Holiday services and festivities. All events take place at the synagogue, located on the second floor of 2000 Chestnut Street in Center City.

Mekor Habracha will host its annual Selichot reception on Saturday, September 8, at 9:30 p.m. Attendees can meet Rabbi Eliezer Hirsch and other Mekor Habracha leaders and learn more about the shul and Center City’s Jewish community. The shul will hold full services on both days of Rosh Hashanah (September 17 and 18) and Yom Kippur (September 26), including evening services the night before. All prayer services are lay-led and are welcoming to individuals of all levels of observance and Jewish knowledge.

Mekor Habracha builds and maintains its own sukkah over Sukkot (October 1-7), and members of the community are invited to use it. Mekor Habracha concludes the High Holiday season with its spirited Simchat Torah celebration the evening of Monday, October 8.

All services and events are open to everyone. Reservations are required for Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur services due to space limitations. However, flexible payment options are available. Anyone interested in attending those services should contact the synagogue at mekorhabracha@gmail.com.
