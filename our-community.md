#Our Community

###Who We Are

Mekor Habracha emerged from a 1990's community-led prayer group in the Rittenhouse Square area of Philadelphia. Since its inception, it has attracted a diverse group of individuals, ranging from students, young professionals, families, and empty nesters. From 1999-2001, the group met under the auspices of the Etz Chaim organization, and reverted to being mainly lay-led until 2006, when Etz Chaim recruited Rabbi Eliezer Hirsch from New York to lead the group. Since Rabbi Hirsch's arrival, the congregation has grown and flourished, eventually becoming an independent synagogue in 2008, and is now a critical contributing organization to the advancement of Jewish life in Center City. Join us soon for a unique Shabbat and Jewish experience!

 
###Our Mission

The mission of Mekor Habracha is to serve the spiritual, social, and educational needs of Center City's diverse Jewish community. We aspire to provide an environment where people of all ages and religious backgrounds are welcome to participate in the synagogue's activities and Orthodox services.
