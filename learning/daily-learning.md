### Gemara and Halacha Chavura: Mekor's Morning Learning Group

Mekor's morning chavura learning, led by Rabbi Hirsch, is held from Monday to Friday, immediately after Shacharit.

At around 7:35 am we learn a halacha or two from Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim (currently Hilchot Tefila or Inyanei D'yoma), followed by Talmud Mesechet Brachot Chapter 6, *Keitzad Mevarchim al haPerot*, which is the source of halachot of blessings on food. We cover the Rishonim, Shulchan Aruch, Acharonim, Poskim and end with the practical halachic application.

If you are interested in participating, please contact the shul or the rabbi.
