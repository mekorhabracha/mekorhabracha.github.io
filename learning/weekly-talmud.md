### Rabbi Hirsch's Talmud Class

Every Shabbat during daylight savings time, 45 minutes before Miná¸¥a, come and learn from Tractate Megila in Mekor's main hall and stay for Third Meal and Ma'ariv.

### Talmud with Adam Romanoski

Every Wednesday at 7pm, in Mekor's main hall. The general topic of our study is how the institution of marriage functions in a legal sense, but many other topics come up (...of course, it's Talmud!). All levels are welcome and everything is explained.
