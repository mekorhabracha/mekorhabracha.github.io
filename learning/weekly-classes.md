### Torah Reading Class (Ta'amei HaMikra) led by Dr. Yonatan Cohen

Mondays, May 8, 15 & 22; June 5, 12, & 19, 7:30–8:30 pm  
Torah is the basis for all that is Judaism, and thus our relationship to Torah should be nuanced and based on intimate and multi-faceted knowledge. In shul, we read it with trope, which is an ancient and important way of learning Torah This series of classes will introduce you to the logic of this system and is designed for lainers and non-lainers alike. We will learn and practice each new concept so that you become aware of the various layers of laining and become proficient in reading Torah. Please email the shul to sign up.

### Rabbi Hirsch's Talmud Class

Every Shabbat during daylight savings time, 45 minutes before Minḥa, come and learn from Tractate Megila in Mekor's main hall and stay for Third Meal and Ma'ariv.

### Talmud with Adam Romanoski

Every Wednesday at 7pm, in Mekor's main hall. The general topic of our study is how the institution of marriage functions in a legal sense, but many other topics come up (...of course, it's Talmud!). All levels are welcome and everything is explained.
