# 2016 Scholar-In-Residence Shabbaton Series

Mekor Habracha is thrilled to announce three special Scholar-In-Residence Shabbatons which will take place at the shul. Thanks to the sponsorship of the [Kohelet Foundation](http://www.koheletfoundation.org/), in each of three separate Shabbatot in February, April and May, we will host an engaging, world renowned Modern Orthodox Jewish leader who will teach about exciting, relevant Jewish topics over the course of Shabbat. 

## February Shabbaton

Save the date! The first of three programs is scheduled for Shabbat Parshat Tetzaveh, **February 19-20**, when we will be hosting Dr. Rabbi Gil Perl, Head of School, Kohelet Yeshiva High School. 

Rabbi Perl, a trailblazing Modern Orthodox Scholar who focuses on topics such as Faith in our Future and Defining Modern Orthodoxy, will enlighten us over Shabbat with his unique perspective on a wide range of Jewish topics.

This exciting Shabbat will also feature melodic Shabbat services, two delicious community Shabbat meals (RSVP required) and a soulful Oneg Shabbat.
