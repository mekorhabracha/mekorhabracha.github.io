### Who We Are

Mekor Habracha is a vibrant and inclusive congregation located in Center City, Philadelphia. We have a diverse membership from all across the city, and visitors, whether local residents or out-of-towners, are always welcome.

Since it was founded in 2007, the Shul has attracted, and continues to attract a diverse group of people including students, young professionals, newlyweds, families and empty nesters. We offer a range of religious, educational and social activities, as well as plenty of opportunities for community members to get involved. 

### Our History

Mekor Habracha emerged from a 1990s independent *chavura* in the Rittenhouse Square area of Philadelphia. From 1999 to 2001 the group met under the auspices of [Etz Chaim](http://www.etzchaimcenter.org), and reverted to being mainly lay-led until 2006, when Etz Chaim recruited [Rabbi Eliezer Hirsch](our-rabbi.html) from New York to lead the group. Since Rabbi Hirsch's arrival, the congregation has grown and flourished, eventually becoming an independent synagogue in 2007, and is now a critical contributing organization to the advancement of Jewish life in Center City.

### Our Mission

The mission of Mekor Habracha is to serve the spiritual, social, and educational needs of Center City's diverse Jewish community. We aspire to provide an environment where people of all ages and religious backgrounds are welcome to participate in the synagogue's activities and Orthodox services.
