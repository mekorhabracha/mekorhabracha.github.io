### Friday Evening

During the summer months Mincha, Kabbalat Shabbat and Ma'ariv take place on Friday evenings immediately after candlelighting time. During the winter services start at 7pm.

### Saturday Morning

Shabbat morning services at Mekor Habracha start at 9:15am and are followed by [a delicious hot kiddush]({{ site.baseurl }}/contribute/kiddush.html). During services, our younger members can enjoy themselves in [Cookie Minyan]({{ site.baseurl }}/kids/cookie-minyan.html).

During the winter months Mincha takes place immediately after Kiddush, at the earliest zman possible.

### Saturday Evening

During the summer months, while Daylight Savings Time is in force, Mekor's afternoon services, consisting on Mincha, third meal and Ma'ariv, start between one and one and a half hours before Havdalah. Services are often preceded by [a 45-minute to one-hour lecture by Rabbi Hirsch]({{ site.baseurl }}/learning/weekly-classes.html).

During the winter Ma'ariv services are scheduled around 15 minutes before Havdalah, and there is typically no third meal.
