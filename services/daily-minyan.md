Weekday services start earlier when there is Mussaf, Hallel and other additional prayers --- do not forget to check the [calendar]({{ site.baseurl }}/calendar.html) for further detail for specific days.

### Afternoons

Currently Mekor Habracha does **not** hold Mincha/Ma'ariv services on weekdays. If you are interested in starting a Mincha/Ma'ariv minyan at Mekor, please contact the Rabbi.

The closest afternoon minyan is at the University of Pennsylvania Hillel at 215 S 39th Street, off Walnut Street. Their website provides further detail about [minyan times](https://www.pennocp.org/minyan/).

From Monday to Thursday there are early Mincha minyanim at 1:50pm in the lobby of 1818 Market Street and at 2pm on the second floor of 1420 Walnut Street.
