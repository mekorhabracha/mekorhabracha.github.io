### Mornings

Join us for Shacharit, followed by breakfast and [learning]({{ site.baseurl }}/learning/daily-learning.html)!

- On regular weekdays services start at 7am, or at 6:45am if there is Torah reading (Mondays and Thursdays).
- On Sundays and secular holidays services start at 9am.

Weekday services start earlier when there is Mussaf, Hallel and other additional prayers --- do not forget to check the [calendar]({{ site.baseurl }}/calendar.html) for further detail for specific days.

### Afternoons

Currently Mekor Habracha does **not*** hold Mincha/Ma'ariv services on weekdays. The closest afternoon minyan is at the University of Pennsylvania Hillel at 215 S 39th Street, off Walnut Street. Their website provides further detail about [minyan times](https://www.pennocp.org/minyan/).

If you are interested in starting a Mincha/Ma'ariv minyan, please contact the Rabbi.
