### Maot Chitin

There is a traditional practice called 'Maot Chitin' or 'Kimcha D'Pischa' which is giving charity to those who cannot afford their Passover expenses. The shul has created a special fund to help individuals fulfill this important mitzvah. If you would like to donate to this fund, please send an email to the shul ASAP with the amount you wish to pledge. 
Best wishes for a happy and kosher Pesach!
