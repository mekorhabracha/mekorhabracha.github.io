In addition to [volunteering at Mekor]({{ site.baseurl }}/contribute/volunteer.html), there are many ways to take an active role in the Greater Philadelphia Jewish community:

# [Jewish Family and Children’s Service](https://www.jfcsphilly.org/)

**Jewish Family and Children’s Service of Greater Philadelphia** has a series of programs aiming at strengthening families and individuals across generations and cultures to achieve stability, independence and community.

### [JCFS Older Adult and Senior Transportation Services](https://www.jfcsphilly.org/main-home-page/older-adults/transportation-services/)

When older adults give up their car or find it difficult to navigate public transportation, the Jewish Family and Children’s Service of Greater Philadelphia can help. Depending on an individual’s location and situation, JFCS provides scheduled shopping vans as well as volunteer transportation services to help transport older adults and seniors and enable them to live independently.

JFCS is seeking compassionate volunteers to help with transportation. There are no set schedules and you can drive as much or as little as you choose. Call JFCS today to learn more, (267) 256-2078.

# [Leket Israel](https://www.leket.org/en/)

As Israel’s largest food rescue organization, **Leket Israel** alleviates nutritional insecurity amongst the growing numbers of Israel’s poor. Food that would have otherwise gone to waste, is redistributed to some 140,000 Israelis each week. Each dollar donated to Leket Israel provides 10 lbs. of fresh fruit and vegetables or 4 high quality meat meals to the poor. To learn more, volunteer or make a donation, visit [their website](https://www.leket.org/en/).

# [Jewish Relief Agency](http://www.jewishrelief.org/philadelphia.html)

**JRA Philadelphia** is the largest provider of food assistance to Jewish families in need in the Greater Philadelphia region and is the third largest direct-service food pantry in our area. One Sunday each month, 750-1,000+ volunteers of all ages and backgrounds meet at the JRA's Northeast Philadelphia warehouse. These volunteers pack fresh produce and non-perishable kosher food, load their cars with boxes, and deliver food and a smile into the homes of those in need. 

For more information, check out [their website](http://www.jewishrelief.org/philly-food-distributions.html).

# [Mitzvah Food Project](https://www.jewishphilly.org/programs-and-services/mitzvah-food-project)

The **Mitzvah Food Project** is looking for volunteers at our food pantry in Center City (Jewish Communal Services Building at 21st and Arch) to assist with evening walk-in hours twice a month on Thursdays from 5 PM to 6:30 PM. They are also looking for drivers to deliver food boxes to seniors in South Philadelphia once a month. For more information call (215) 832-0509 or email foodproject@jfgp.org.

# [Court Appointed Special Advocates](http://www.casaphiladelphia.org/)

**CASA of Philadelphia County** trains and supports community volunteers to become sworn officers of the court to speak up for the safety, stability, health and well-being of abused and neglected children in the foster care system. Volunteers become the “eyes and ears” for the court in making recommendations for what is in the child’s best interest. For more information, please contact Cindy Blum, EdM, Volunteer Coordinator, at (267) 519-5325.
