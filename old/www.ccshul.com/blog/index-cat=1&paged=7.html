					<p>Working to Create a Modern Orthodox Community Oct 16, 2013 By: Eric Berger </p>
<p>http://www.jewishexponent.com/working-to-create-a-modern-orthodox-community</p>
<p>In five years, Mekor Habracha has mushroomed from an informal prayer group to full-blown Center City shul with more than 250 members, many of them young urbanites looking to explore a more observant lifestyle.</p>
<p>For nearly two weeks, while Andres Catalan’s baby son was in intensive care, members of his synagogue were anxiously waiting for some news.</p>
<p>Rabbi Eli Hirsch, of Mekor Habracha, the Orthodox congregation in Center City, sent an email the afternoon of Sept. 24 saying  the boy’s condition had improved to where his parents were taking him home and were ready to welcome him into the community. Within a few hours, more than 40 people had gathered at the shul for the baby’s bris.</p>
<p>“Everyone comes to the rescue — it’s amazing,” said Catalan, who is from Bar­celona, is completing his doctorate in operations management at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School and teaches at Temple University. “This year, I had two work offers — one to move to Paris and one to stay in Philly — and pretty much, the community here is what tipped the balance.”</p>
<p>Since Mekor split in 2008 from the Etz Chaim Center for Jewish Studies, where it had been an informal prayer group of several dozen people, the shul has grown considerably. The congregation now has more than 250 members and is considering relocating from the second floor of a nondescript building at 20th and Chestnut streets to a larger space.</p>
<p>That growth has made it easier for young professionals, like Catalan, 32, who are interested in exploring a more observant lifestyle, to remain near Rittenhouse Square. Other Orthodox options are more of a hike, such as B’nai Abraham or the Vilna Congregation in Society Hill and the Sephardi congregation, Mikveh Israel, near Independence Mall.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the urbanites might feel compelled to leave the convenience and bustle of Center City for a more established Orthodox community like one in Lower Merion.</p>
<p>The momentum at Mekor is also part of a larger resurgence of Jewish life in Center City, where residents have started new prayer groups, such as the traditional lay-led Minyan Tikvah. Meanwhile, established congregations have seen an uptick in membership in recent years. Rodeph Shalom, a historic Reform congregation on North Broad Street, invested $5.5 million to renovate its sanctuary in 2005 and has become a hub of Jewish activity, particularly for young families. And groups such as the Chevra and the Collaborative, which organize social events for young Jewish professionals, have become mainstays of the Center City scene.</p>
<p>At Mekor, members say that a shared interest in building a Jewish community in Center City has motivated them not only to gather for morning services and regular programs at the synagogue — the congregation initially met primarily just on Shabbat — but also to work toward building the institutions that accompany an observant lifestyle in the city.</p>
<p>Catalan, who met his wife, Yah-el Har-el, at Mekor, credits Hirsch with the close ties and growth that have occurred at the shul.</p>
<p>“He is very empathetic, reaching out and understanding what your situation is,” said Catalan, a member of Mekor since 2010.</p>
<p>In many ways, the congregation appears to be a reflection of the rabbi and his wife, a modern urban couple.</p>
<p>Hirsch, 43, works as an options trader for a small hedge fund, a position he described as more of a hobby compared to his primary occupation leading the synagogue. His wife, Miriam Ort, 33, is a senior director of human resources for PepsiCo in New York. They don’t have any children and keep an apartment on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in addition to their residence in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>The majority of the congregation is comprised of singles and couples in their 20s and 30s who work in the city and span the spectrum of religious observance.</p>
<p>“One of the things I believe Torah teaches is you can’t judge anybody based on observance level,” said Hirsch, who received his ordination from Yeshiva Ohr Reuven in Wesley Hills, N.Y. (Ed &#8211; he also received ordination from Yeshiva Ner Yisroel in Baltimore, MD)</p>
<p>In addition to calling out page numbers during services and directing people when to sit or stand  — practices usually associated with more liberal streams of Judaism — Hirsch and others at Mekor also work on the nuts and bolts of building a traditional Jewish community.</p>
<p>For example, there are now a handful more kosher vegetarian options in Center City — Blackbird Vegan Pizza, MiLah Vegetarian and Falafel Bar among them — than there were four years ago — thanks in part to the efforts of Hirsch and Mekor members. Around that time, the International Kosher Council approached Hirsch asking for his help in certifying and supervising restaurants in Philadelphia. Since then, the council’s mashgiach has conducted the initial<br />
inspections for restaurants and then trained-Mekor members have conducted inspections at the restaurants at least once each week.</p>
<p>The congregation also helps maintain the area’s eruv, a device that connects telephone poles and wires to enclose an area, allowing people to carry on Shabbat, which is otherwise forbidden. Mekor members are also involved with plans for a mikvah in Center City.</p>
<p>Hirsch said such infrastructure helps build community, which is ultimately what will make Center City an attractive place for observant Jews.</p>
<p>“People don’t want to move to a desert” where there is no viable Modern Orthodox community, Hirsch said. “The bigger the community gets, the more people feel comfortable living here.”</p>
<p>Jonathan Gradman, a 29-year-old former beer brewer in Brooklyn, said there were about 10 people at Shabbat services when he first came to Mekor with his wife, Lexi Scheiber Gradman, after moving to Philadelphia in 2009 for graduate school at Drexel University. Last month, while standing underneath a full sukkah in an alley near the shul, he said the numbers had grown quickly.</p>
<p>“Coming from a shul in Brooklyn, it was — not somber, but a more austere atmosphere. Here, everyone’s young; everyone wants to have a good time,” Gradman said while holding his infant son, Yuval.</p>
<p>Mekor now draws a large number for its monthly Friday night Kabbalat Shabbat services and dinner and hires a chazzan to lead the services. On Saturday mornings, the 125 chairs inside the shul are usually filled, Hirsch said.</p>
<p>The congregation was outbid when it tried to buy a vacant church at 19th and Pine streets earlier this year, but Hirsch said they are continuing to look for a new building.</p>
<p>“We know the way things are going right now, it looks like we’re going to need a new space soon,” said Hirsch.</p>
<p>There has also been talk of starting a co-ed community Jewish day school in Center City, initially with just kindergarten and first grade.</p>
<p>Plans for the school, potluck meals in parks around Center City and “Tot Shabbats” aim to make Mekor a comfortable place for young singles and families, but the shul is not just a place for the under-40 crowd.</p>
<p>Bruce Taubman, the president of Mekor, has been involved with the congregation since it started with Etz Chaim. The 66-year-old pediatrician said the rabbi’s efforts to make sure that everyone attending services feels included is what defines the congregation.</p>
<p>“He is very good with young people and he has an attitude of wanting to have everyone, from whatever background, feel comfortable in our shul. And whatever halachically in Orthodoxy is allowed for women, he wants them to feel as comfortable as possible and that’s the same philosophy that<br />
I have,” said Taubman. “He strongly believes that Orthodox Jews can keep their Orthodoxy and be part of the secular world.”</p>
<p>Rhona Gerber, an event planner, joined Mekor with her husband and two children about four years ago after being a longtime member of Temple Beth Zion-Beth Israel, a Conservative synagogue in Center City. She said she doesn’t think her religious practices have changed from one synagogue to the other.</p>
<p>They kept Shabbat before joining Mekor and she would still prefer an egalitarian service. But she and her husband like the feeling on Friday nights at Me­kor and the fact that the congregation welcomes Shabbat according to candlelighting times. Those qualities outweigh other considerations.</p>
<p>“It really has a great aura of Shabbat and that was important to our family,” said Gerber, 48.</p>
<p>She also wanted to support Mekor because of what it meant for the Jewish community in Center City.</p>
<p>“The more shuls you have for people to choose from,” Gerber said. “the more kosher restaurants — and God-willing, some day, a Jewish day school — the more vibrant the community will be and the more people will want to live here.”</p>

					<p>Thank you, Rela Mintz Geffen, for recognizing Mekor Habracha synagogue as one of &#8220;the pockets of success&#8221; in energizing the young-adult Jewish community in Center City (Opinions: &#8220;Focusing on Kids Makes Sense, but What About Singles?&#8221; Jan. 21).</p>
<p>Ours is a vibrant, grass-roots congregation, with a large percentage of membership comprised of students and young professionals. It is wonderful to see many former participants in Birthright trips and similar programs gravitating to our shul to maintain and grow their connection to Judaism in a traditional setting.</p>
<p>We hope that others will come to appreciate that building communities attractive to this demographic may be one of the most vital elements of engaging the next Jewish generation.</p>
<p>Rabbi Eliezer Hirsch<br />

<p>Rabbi Peter Rigler, as recently as a year ago, said he thought that there was little chance of marriage equality being achieved anytime soon in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>But after State Reps. Brian Sims and Steve McCarter announced Thursday at Love Park in Center City a new bill to legalize same-sex marriage, Rigler, of Temple Sholom, a Reform congregation in Broomall, said he thinks the prospects of such legislation passing have improved considerably.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel much more confident that the tide is changing,&#8221; said Rigler, who helped launch a Facebook page last year, Marriage Equality in PA — NOW! [1], to help advance the cause.</p>
<p> &#8220;A year ago, I think there was a sense of &#8216;We shouldn’t even talk about this issue; it’s not going to go anywhere.&#8217; ”</p>
<p>The legislators, both Democrats from the Philadelphia area, spoke optimistically about the legalization of same-sex marriage in spite of opposition from Gov. Tom Corbett and members of the Republican majorities in the state House and Senate.</p>
<p>Sims, a civil rights attorney who last year became the first openly gay candidate elected to the state Legislature, said he was “100 percent” certain such legislation would pass. It was just a matter of how and when.</p>
<p>“This is not innovative legislation,” Sims said, referring to the 13 states and the District of Columbia that allow gay couples to marry.</p>
<p>There are 35 co-sponsors of the bill thus far, including Rep. Chris Ross, a Republican from Chester County.</p>
<p>State Sen. Daylin Leach first introduced a same-sex marriage bill in 2009 in the state Senate but received little support. Leach, who is running for the U.S. Congress, has continued to introduce his own marriage equality bill during the past three legislative sessions.</p>
<p>“Talk to young people, liberals, conservatives, Democrats, Republicans — they disagree on many issues but almost none of them have any interest in perpetuating a policy of discrimination,” said Leach.  “This is a policy that is a dead-man-walking policy. It’s on its way out.”</p>
<p>Leach referred to the low divorce rate in Massachusetts, which was the first state to allow same-sex marriage. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, states that allow same-sex marriage on average have lower divorce rates than those that ban the practice.</p>
<p>“There is no reasonable, rational, fact-based argument against marriage equality,&#8221; Leach said. &#8220;It’s simply a religious argument or some people are uncomfortable with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shelley Kapnek Rosenberg, an ally of the LGBTQ community, said it&#8217;s &#8220;overdue and past time&#8221; for same-sex marriage to be legalized.</p>
<p>&#8220;My daughter and her partner ought to have the same right to get married as any other person,&#8221; said Rosenberg, whose daughter is a rabbinic student.</p>
<p>But Rosenberg, who is the co-chair of a program that provides mentorship to families of members of the LGBTQ community, said legalizing same-sex marriage is just one piece in the larger fight for equality. She is also involved with efforts to ensure that people are not discriminated against in the workplace on the basis of their sexual orientation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any piece of legislation that is opening someone&#8217;s eyes to discrimination is a good thing,&#8221; said Rosenberg, a Jenkintown resident.</p>
<p>Rabbi Eliezer Hirsch of Mekor Habracha, an Orthodox shul in Center City, declined to say whether he supported or opposed the bill but referred to the history of Jews being persecuted for their religious beliefs. While most Jews support gay marriage, many Orthodox Jews oppose it because they say it goes against Jewish law.</p>
<p>&#8220;We, of all people,&#8221; Hirsch said.  &#8220;should be sensitive to ensure that no one&#8217;s rights are curbed by the religous beliefs of others.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rabbi Yonah Gross of Congregation Beth Hamedrosh, an Orthodox shul in Wynnewood, has expressed misgivings about the changing nature of marriage in America but said taking a stand against the legislation was not high on his priority list.</p>
<p>“The reason I would not be very invested in it is because I don’t think” the legalization of same-sex marriage is “relevant to my synagogue and my job here,” he said.</p>
<p>Rabbi Neil Cooper of Temple Beth Hillel- Beth El, a Conservative synagogue in Wynnewood, said the Jewish community&#8217;s response &#8220;needs to be one of embrace and a non-judgmental kind of embrace.&#8221;</p>
<p>But he declined ot say whether he would officiate at a same-sex marriage should the legislation become law.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that people have a right to get married and they should be able to marry who they want,&#8221; Cooper said. &#8220;But from a perspective of Jewish tradition, there is a question of how Judaism can accept and incorporate same-sex couples into a traditional community.&#8221;</p>
