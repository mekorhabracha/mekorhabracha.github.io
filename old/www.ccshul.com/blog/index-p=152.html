				<p>TO:   	Mekor Habracha Members  </p>
<p>FROM: Mekor Habracha Board of Directors  </p>
<p>RE:  	Annual Mekor Habracha Community Meeting  </p>
<p>DATE: July 18, 2013   </p>
<p>On Sunday, July 14 from 7-8:30 PM, the annual Mekor Habracha Community Meeting took place.  This meeting was an opportunity to update the community on the state of the shul, introduce the community to the Mekor Habracha board of directors, and to open up for discussion issues and opportunities the shul faces currently and in the near future.   </p>
<p>Rabbi Hirsch opened the meeting with a brief d’var Torah, followed by Dr. Bruce Taubman, President, offering a “state of the shul” summary for the community.  Board member Deborah Diamond then summarized opportunities for community members to volunteer and get involved in the shul and the meeting was opened for discussion and questions.   </p>
<p>STATE OF THE SHUL </p>
<p>Membership:   The shul has grown substantially over the last year. Since the shul’s founding seven years ago, membership has grown substantially&#8230;<br />
The board of directors of the shul is committed to maintaining an accessible membership dues structure.  This necessitates raising additional money for the shul’s operations through annual giving/pledges&#8230;<br />
Volunteer Opportunities:  As the shul grows in members, the need for programming and the resources to meet those needs grows as well. Deborah Diamond outlined the opportunities to get involved with an existing shul committee, become more active/involved in existing activities, or to start a program/initiative as needed.</p>
<p>COMMUNITY DISCUSSION<br />
The open discussion covered four main areas:<br />
1.	The shul’s fundraising needs and strategies.<br />
2.	Accommodating the growing number of children.<br />
3.	The continued search for space and/or a permanent home/building.<br />
4.	The strategic vision for the shul’s future.     </p>
<p>With the growth of the Mekor Habracha community comes the opportunity to think more broadly and long-term about the future of the shul.  Some examples that were discussed at the meeting include: beginning to save for a building of our own through a building fund; accommodating the increasing number of children etc&#8230;</p>
<p>NEXT STEPS/ACTION ITEMS<br />
The meeting led to some immediate next steps and action items:<br />
•	The creation of a building committee to focus on the two issues of finding better space for the shul and funding a building that suits our growing needs. This committee should include the real estate professionals already associated with the shul.  The mission of this committee will be to define a strategy, timeline and fundraising goals around more permanent and adequate space for Mekor Habracha.<br />
•	The creation of a committee for children’s programming that would tackle the two issues of better use for the space for children and programming/babysitting services that would satisfy the needs of parents who want to bring children to shul and also to daven.   </p>
<p>The board made clear its openness to rearrange the current rooms to accommodate children better, including: mild reconstruction&#8230;</p>
<p>In addition, it was suggested that childcare be added for the upcoming high holidays, for those families that would like to bring children to shul&#8230;</p>
<p>•	Strategic Planning. The board will discuss the need for a strategic plan for the shul that&#8230;would articulate the shul’s vision for its future; and that would serve as a catalyst for growing the shul’s membership and financial resources.  As one meeting attendee said: We should have a plan in place in order to be able to grow.   </p>
