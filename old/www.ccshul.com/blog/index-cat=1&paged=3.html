<p>Calling Attention to Plight of &#8220;Chained&#8221; Women<br />
MARCH 4, 2015<br />
By: Debra Forman</p>
<p>Bracha and Seth Rosenstein recently signed a post-nuptial agreement to take a stand against the practice that allows a husband to refuse to grant his wife a Jewish divorce, or get.</p>
<p>With their 10-month-old son, Meir, as a witness, the happily married couple attended a two-hour halachic “post-nup party” on March 1, organized by the advocacy group, the Organization for the Resolution of Agunot, known as ORA.</p>
<p>Despite the freezing rain and frigid weather, a small but dedicated group of rabbis, couples and community members gathered at Mekor Habracha, a Modern Orthodox synagogue in Center City, to decry the practice of get refusal and recalcitrant husbands and to stand up for the women who are left in limbo when their husbands refuse to grant them a get.</p>
<p>These women bear a modern-day scarlet letter and are referred to as agunot, which literally means they are chained or anchored to a dead marriage and not halachically allowed to remarry.</p>
<p>Plans are in the works for a second post-nuptial party in Philadelphia or the nearby suburbs to take place after Passover.</p>
<p>“I think it’s unreasonable that in the struggles of divorce, someone would not be able to move on with their lives,” Bracha Rosenstein, 31, explained of her decision to sign a religious post-nuptial agreement that was witnessed by a notary.</p>
<p>“My husband and I felt that had we considered this before we got married, we would have signed it,” she said. “Our feeling is that God forbid anything would happen in our marriage, we would be able to pre-emptively support each other.”</p>
<p>Rabbi Eliezer Hirsch, the spiritual leader at Mekor Habracha, feels so strongly about this issue that he refuses to marry couples unless they sign a Jewish pre-nuptial agreement.</p>
<p>“I feel blessed to say that I have never had a couple at whose wedding I officiated that later ended their marriage with divorce,” said Rabbi Hirsch, 44. “But I also think it’s a terrible thing that has developed. It is important to increase awareness that some men are using the get as a weapon against their wives and this definitely needs to stop.”</p>
<p>While some younger couples may feel that a Jewish pre-nup takes some of the romance out of embarking on their life journey, Hirsch said he presents the idea in a different way to skittish couples. “I tell them not to look at this as being afraid of getting a divorce,” he advises, “but instead to view this as if you are signing a petition that you agree every couple should sign so that get refusal never happens again.”</p>
<p>Hirsch said he also explains to couples who are considering marriage that every aspect of the Torah has to do with relationships and the wording in the Jewish marriage contract, the ketubah, refers to the husband’s “commitment and devotion going so deep that he will give her the shirt off his back. I find that to be very romantic.”</p>
<p>At the post-nup party on March 1, ORA’s executive director, Rabbi Jeremy Stern, showed a video about ORA’s work and explained why widespread community support is needed to encourage the use of a pre-nuptial religious contract so that the issue of the agunah will cease to exist.</p>
<p>“This is a horrible thing that women endure, and I consider a get refusal to be a form of domestic abuse,” said Eileen Sklaroff, who attended the party with her husband of 16 years, Cantor Mark Kushner, a certified mohel.</p>
<p>Even after a civil divorce, “without a get you are still considered married, your life is in limbo and your ex-husband still has control over you,” explained Sklaroff, 68. “The woman cannot remarry in a Jewish ceremony and her future children are considered illegitimate, especially in the Orthodox world. Some of us are signing post-nups after being married for 30 or 40 years to show our support for these beleaguered women throughout the world.”</p>
<p>Although not personally touched by the issue, Sklaroff was so moved by this cause that she, as a member of the executive committee of Women of Vision, helped ORA draft a grant proposal for educational programs in the Greater Philadelphia area. Women of Vision, the permanent Jewish Women’s Foundation of the Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia, awarded funding for this program for two consecutive grant cycles.</p>
<p>For an abusive husband, the get represents the last vestige of control he has over his estranged wife. He holds the power to decide whether she will have the freedom to move on with her life and find happiness in another relationship or remain trapped in a dead marriage with little hope of escape.</p>
<p>The New York City-based ORA was started in 2002 by Yeshiva University students, and the international nonprofit group is recognized as a prominent voice in agunah advocacy.</p>
<p>ORA (getora.org) has educational programs funded by Jewish Women’s Foundations in Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. and a satellite office in Israel. As a result of the dedication to resolving cases of get refusal, ORA&#8217;s assistant director Kimberly Hay said her group has succeeded in securing the freedom for more than 230 women.</p>
<p>The group has impacted Jewish communities around the world from Reform to Orthodox.</p>
<p>In one of the more widely publicized cases, a husband finally granted his wife a get after 18 years of refusal and family heartache, according to ORA officials.</p>
<p>One highly publicized recent Jewish divorce cases involved Bala Cynwyd resident Tamar Epstein.Epstein and her former husband Aharon Friedman, an aide to U.S. Rep. David Camp, received a civil divorce in 2010, but for nearly six years Epstein tried unsuccessfully to receive a get.</p>
<p>In December 2013, ORA, which had spearheaded the campaign “to free” Epstein, issued a formal announcement celebrating Epstein’s freedom, thus resolving the complicated case to Epstein and ORA’s satisfaction, the group said. Whether or not she actually received a get remains unclear.</p>
<p>“ORA was actively involved in the well-known case of Tamar Epstein, who fought her husband and sought a get for close to six years,” Hay said on Monday. “Epstein is no longer seeking a get and ORA is no longer involved in the case.”</p>

<h2 class="title">Making Carrying Shabbat-Friendly</h2>
<div class="content"><span class="date-display-single">February 25, 2015</span></p>
<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden">
<p>On a cold Thursday afternoon in the Fairmount section of Philadelphia, Rabbi Rephoel Szmerla sits atop his bicycle and ducks from sidewalk to street, staying close to the utility poles. He wears a bright orange vest and a yellow hard hat. But he does not work for a telephone or electric company.</p>
<p>Rather, Szmerla, from Lakewood, N.J., oversees the maintenance and repair of 16 eruvin — devices that create the boundaries that allow religiously observant Jews to carry items within a public area on Shabbat — in the Philadelphia area and New Jersey.</p>
<p>“It’s important for a Jewish community to have an eruv because on Shabbat, a Jew is not allowed to carry anything from his house to the street” because of Jewish law, “and in today’s day and age, in most communities, people find it very difficult to manage under those circumstances,” said Szmerla.</p>
<p>The devices mark boundaries, which can be denoted by pre-existing structures like buildings or fences, considered “natural,” or by strings and material that Szmerla and others construct between poles.</p>
<p>Spotting an eruv or figuring out how it works can be difficult. As a description on <strong><a href="http://www.chabad.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">chabad.org</a> <span class="print-footnote">[1]</span></strong> states, “It is one of those traditions which has blossomed from a basic Torah principle into a highly complicated legal matter.” Hence the need for someone like Szmerla, who also leads an Orthodox congregation in Lakewood.</p>
<p>He helps to maintain eruvin, which serve a spiritual purpose, by spending plenty of time dealing with the practical challenges related to the required permits and public infrastructure. Eruvin can also have an impact on the secular world because their existence can draw Orthodox Jewish families to an area and, in some cases, boost property values.</p>
<p>That connection could soon play out as members of the Center City congregation Mekor HaBracha work with Szmerla and other rabbis over the next couple of months to expand the Center City eruv south of Washington Avenue to an area that includes the Point Breeze neighborhood.</p>
<p>Thirty years ago, Szmerla, 52, moved from his native Paris to Lakewood, a New Jersey city with a large Orthodox community. His involvement with the Philadelphia eruvin began about 15 years ago when he was learning at the Bensalem Community Kollel. While studying at a yeshiva in Lakewood, he had learned the laws of the ritual enclosure — something that not all rabbis do — and Orthodox leaders approached him about checking the eruv in Northeast Philadelphia because the rabbi who had done so previously no longer could.</p>
<p>About five years later, when an electric company said it could no longer handle the repairs for the Philadelphia eruvin, Szmerla considered taking over. He wasn’t sure it would be lucrative enough, but then he helped the Bensalem Orthodox community construct an eruv and used the money he earned from that project to purchase a bucket truck.</p>
<p>A typical day for him begins with a ride around the border of an eruv to make sure the “walls” are still intact.</p>
<p>During the winter, wires and string can snap under the weight of snow, so the eruvin require extra maintenance. In Northeast Philadelphia, the city recently upgraded its poles and traffic lights to be able to better withstand a storm like Superstorm Sandy. As a result of those changes, he said, “All the strings and all the attachments on the old poles crossing Bustleton Avenue had to be changed.”</p>
<p>As he rode through Fairmount, Szmerla scanned the poles and made mental notes of where he would need to make repairs. His bicycle had an electric motor, but its battery had died after he started the ride at I-95 and the Ben Franklin Bridge, so now he was just peddling with extra weight.</p>
<p>After completing the lap around the Center City eruv — down along I-95, west on Washington, north following the Schuylkill River and east on Poplar — he returned to his bucket truck and then drove to make the repairs. He can’t just do it all from the truck, he explained, because he can’t get close enough to the poles or stop and start the way he can on his bike.</p>
<p>Before he started doing the work himself, he said, he had been “frustrated to see that repairs weren’t always done properly. It was an electrician — who was non-Jewish — and he didn’t know too much about the halachic requirements, so he did it according to his understanding.”</p>
<p>“I get the satisfaction of knowing that the repairs are done well in a manner that is satisfactory according to halacha,” said Szmerla, who has nine children.</p>
<p>Police have stopped Szmerla many times and asked him what he’s doing, he said. A few years ago, one officer even requested his permit papers, which Szmerla always carries.</p>
<p>“He looks at me, and he tells me, ‘Are you kidding me? These are 20 years old.’ So I told him, ‘Yes, officer, but look — it says it’s valid for 25 years.’ He looked again and said, ‘Oh, right.’ ”</p>
<p>Rabbi Eliezer Hirsch, who leads Mekor HaBracha, said Szmerla wears the hard hat and vest for a reason.</p>
<p>“Even though we have permits from the city and it’s sanctioned, he tries to look as official as possible,” said Hirsch. While Szmerla usually comes at least once a month, Hirsch and his congregants fill in in-between, rotating weekly volunteer shifts to check the Center City eruv before Shabbat. Members of the Center City Orthodox synagogues Mikveh Israel and B’nai Abraham also volunteer.</p>
<p>After the weekly check and repairs have been made, the Center City volunteers then update a website and send an email to let residents know whether the eruv is up.</p>
<p>When an eruv is down, it can have a profound effect on an observant community. Jewish law prohibits people in public spaces on Shabbat from even carrying a baby, not to mention canes, keys and strollers.</p>
<p>Before the construction of the Center City eruv in 2006, “some people with families would be stuck at home — we had very few families in Center City with children” because “they couldn’t really take their children out on Shabbas in a way that is halachically permissible,” said Hirsch, who moved to Center City a year before the eruv went up. Without it, he explained, he had to wear a Shabbat belt, a device that allows you to, in effect, “wear” — not carry — your keys and other items.</p>
<p>Since then, the Orthodox community in the city has grown considerably, to the point where there is now talk of opening an elementary school and building a mikveh.</p>
<p>“If we didn’t have an eruv and told people to move to Center City, we would be a laughingstock,” said Hirsch, who also lives on the Lower East Side in New York, where there is not an eruv. He told how he once had to drop his formal clothes off at a synagogue before Shabbat, then return home and walk to a synagogue uptown in sneakers. “How can you convince someone to move to a city without an eruv? It’s considered a staple of an observant Jewish community.”</p>
<p>The Center City eruv is usually down, at most, once a year, Hirsch said. And the reason is, he said, because much of the enclosure is “natural,” using highways, fences and buildings, but also because of Szmerla’s responsiveness.</p>
<p>“You have to be very handy and very creative” and know the halachic rules “in order to do what Rabbi Szmerla does. He is incredible at figuring out what to do and actually building what we need.”</p>
<p>Jon Gradman, a member of Mekor HaBracha who coordinates the schedule for the volunteer checkers of the Center City eruv, said people can take the convenience for granted, not realizing the work that Szmerla and others put into it.</p>
<p>“A lot of people assume that there is an eruv in Philly, and it’s just up and that’s how it is,” said Gradman. “And they don’t realize that the reason there is an eruv is because people went out and checked it and maintained it.”</p>

<td><strong>What is an Eruv?</strong>The word “eruv” in Hebrew means “to blend or intermingle.” It serves as a ritual enclosure that allows people to carry items — whether it be a prayer book or a stroller — in a public area on Shabbat.<br />
The device is composed of walls, but that does not necessarily have to be something solid, like the Kotel. For example, a string held taut between telephone poles can also serve as a wall.<br />
“A wall can be a wall even if it has many doorways creating large open spaces,” an explanation on <strong>chabad.org</strong> states.<br />
The eruv does not, however, allow the carrying of items, such as a pen or an umbrella, that are otherwise forbidden on Shabbat.<br />
“The purpose of the eruv is to allow certain basic necessities to be carried, such as a tallit or a prayer book, house keys, clothing which is removed on warm days, and reading glasses,”<br />
according to <strong>chabad.org.</strong> “And it allows the pushing of a baby carriage along with food and diapers.”</td>

<h2 class="title">It&#8217;s All About Location When It Comes to Eruvin</h2>
<div class="content"><span class="date-display-single">February 25, 2015</span></p>
<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden">
<p>The relationship between an eruv and observance can be illustrated by Andres Catalan, an Orthodox resident of Philadelphia who is one of the primary people behind the push to move the boundaries of the Center City eruv southward.</p>
<p>He started working on the plans about six months ago after he and his family decided to stop renting and purchased a home outside the eruv, a ritual enclosure that allows people within it to carry on Shabbat.</p>
<p>Since the move, he and his wife, Yah-el Har-el, have hired a non-Jewish person on Shabbat, in part to push the stroller for their infant son, Uriel.</p>
<p>The difference in home prices between Graduate Hospital, where they had been living, and just a few blocks south in Point Breeze was more than $100,000.</p>
<p>One question that arises is whether tensions between newcomers and longtime residents over gentrification in the south Philadelphia neighborhood would be exacerbated if more observant Jews move south in search of cheaper real estate.</p>
<p>Ori Feibush, a real estate developer, has been one of the biggest investors in Point Breeze in recent years and is now running for City Council in the district. Groups such as Concerned Citizens of Point Breeze have criticized Feibush, who is Jewish, because of how they say his development displaces longtime residents. Mayor Michael Nutter recently was quoted saying at a campaign rally for incumbent Kenyatta Johnson, “We’re not going to allow some little jerk with a big checkbook [to] come in and buy this election.”</p>
<p>When asked about the eruv issue, Feibush, who was not initially familiar with the concept — as many Jews aren’t — said, “I support any effort which provides inclusivity for individuals of many different faiths, and if this is an effort that will allow a community to practice their religion in a larger area, I think that’s great.”</p>
<p>Johnson couldn’t be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Catalan, a professor at Temple University’s Fox School of Business, said he does not know other Mekor HaBracha members who have moved south of Washington in search of cheaper real estate but he does not think that expanding the eruv will be a significant factor in gentrifying the neighborhood or “a source of friction” with longtime residents.</p>
<p>“We should be concerned for everyone in our neighborhood,” said Catalan.</p>
<p>But Mekor HaBracha Rabbi Eliezer Hirsch, who also works as an options trader in New York, said there can be a correlation between an eruv and boosting property values. A real estate agent told the <em>Boston Globe</em> in 2014 that there could be a 10 percent difference in property values between homes inside an eruv verus those outside the boundaries.</p>
<p>Hirsch said he sees a trend of more people moving into Center City and commuting to New York, and he expects that to help his congregation grow. Furthermore, expanding the eruv “could definitely” draw observant Jews into South Philadelphia, though he expects the Center City Jewish community to grow first.</p>
<p>“People are going to move south of Washington and the reason is because of real estate prices,” said Hirsch. “If there is no eruv there, observant Jews aren’t going to feel that’s a viable place to live.”</p>
<p>Orthodox Jews have battled with groups — Jewish and non-Jewish alike — in other parts of the county over building or expanding eruvin. In 2011, members of the Orthodox community in Westhampton Beach, N.Y., filed suit against local governing bodies that they said were preventing them from building an eruv and, over a period of several years, faced off against groups like Jewish People Opposed to the Eruv.</p>
<p>Last summer, a federal judge ruled that the Village of Westhampton Beach could not use a sign ordinance to prevent the community from building an eruv, and it has since gone up.</p>
<p>In Philadelphia, expanding the eruv, which is maintained by Rabbi Rephoel Szmerla, over the next few months south to Porter Street would encompass two additional congregations in southeast Philadelphia: Y.P.C Shari Eli, which is Conservative, and the Orthodox Congregation Shivtei Yeshuron Ezras Israel, also known as The Little Shul. It already includes the Orthodox synagogues Bnai Abraham and Mikveh Israel. The planners also hope to expand it north toward Temple University and west to connect it to the University City eruv, which Szmerla also maintains.</p>
<p>As for the connection between eruvin and property values, Szmerla, who does repairs on eruvin throughout the city, said, “I would imagine that depends on the type of town and community you’re talking about.</p>
<p>“In Center City, where the percentage of people who care about the eruv is a very small fraction of the general population, I doubt that the eruv will have an impact on property value.”</p>

					<p>To the Mekor Habracha community,<br />
As details emerge from the horrifying terrorist attack in Jerusalem, it is difficult to find the words to express our sadness for our brethren in Israel. Under the circumstances, it is natural to feel helpless, angry and/or frustrated about the situation. However, despite our heartbreak, the most effective way we can put our emotions to good use is to connect to Israel as we would to our own immediate family.<br />
Our tradition teaches that the premier method to connect is via what is known as &#8216;the voice of Jacob&#8217; &#8211; prayer and Torah study. This is particularly appropriate in this instance, with the attack brazenly carried out in a place of Torah study and prayer. Psalms is a very fitting place to begin praying, and sincere prayer from the heart in ones native tongue is considered a very potent method as well. When you pray, please have the victims of this terrible attack in mind, as well as a speedy recovery for the survivors. The names of the injured and info regarding the deceased (including the brave Druse police officer attempting to protect the members of the synagogue) can be found here: http://via.readerimpact.com/…/45204ac6964cb4444907c1c804809…<br />
Try to increase your current Torah study schedule by even a couple of minutes; if you don&#8217;t have one, you can start learning something new or visit the many websites that provide Torah learning opportunities (such as aish.com).<br />
We will be saying extra prayers on behalf of our Israeli brethren in shul, and we will be having a special edition of our Thursday night Torah class at 6:15 PM, dedicated to the victims of the attack.<br />
Additionally, consider donating to a cause directly related to helping victims of terror. One Family Fund, a wonderful charity (whose group we once hosted in shul), is one such organization.<br />
There are 26 newly orphaned children saying kaddish as a result of this horrific attack. We must not simply go on with our lives; we owe it to them to strengthen our connection to God, Torah, our community and the Jewish people.<br />
May God soon bring us a consolation from these very painful times, and peace and security to the land of Israel.<br />
Rabbi Eliezer Hirsch<br />
Mekor Habracha/Center City Synagogue</p>
