					<p>Jews do celebrate Halloween &#8230; sort of (commentary from Rabbi Eliezer Hirsch)<br />
Published in The Philadelphia Examiner, Friday, October 28, 2011, 3:20 PM <a href="http://www.examiner.com/jewish-culture-in-philadelphia/jews-do-celebrate-halloween-sort-of-commentary-from-rabbi-eliezer-hirsch">http://www.examiner.com/jewish-culture-in-philadelphia/jews-do-celebrate-halloween-sort-of-commentary-from-rabbi-eliezer-hirsch</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.examiner.com/jewish-culture-in-philadelphia/jews-do-celebrate-halloween-sort-of-commentary-from-rabbi-eliezer-hirsch"></a>I have often heard and read that the Jewish holiday most resembling Halloween is Purim, mostly because of masquerading and varied forms of &#8220;Trick or Treating&#8221; that connect the two days. It is possible, however, that the Jewish holiday of Sukkot, which ended just a few days ago, best fits this bill.<br />
Both Sukkot and the American version of Halloween are harvest festivals, marking the end of the agricultural cycle. We see symbols of pumpkins, corn husks and scarecrows on Halloween, and, on Sukkot, palm, myrtle, and willow branches;  citrons; and outdoor huts primarily built of vegetation.<br />
Both holidays mark the autumn season when plant life slowly begins to shrivel and die as we edge toward winter, and themes of death dominate.<br />
Halloween has scary pumpkins, frightful costumes and more recently, its own horror movies.<br />
Sukkot is called &#8220;chag ha-asif,&#8221; which doubles as &#8220;the harvest celebration” and &#8220;the holiday of death.&#8221; On Sukkot, we read the book of Ecclesiastes, whose Hebrew name, &#8220;Kohelet,&#8221; has the same double translation as &#8220;asif&#8221; (harvest/death). King Solomon, as Ecclesiastes, focuses on the futility of our transient, physical universe, and he teaches that &#8220;better is the day of death than a birthday&#8221; (7:1). The sukkah is invalid unless the roof is made up of shrubs that are dead (Tractate Sukkah 1:4).<br />
The messages of the two harvest festivals may be contrasted: Halloween emphasizes fear of death, while Sukkot is dubbed &#8220;the holiday of happiness&#8221; by our sages. This may teach that acceptance of death is the key to finding true happiness.<br />
If we ponder this point, we may come to realize that uniqueness and meaning is a direct product of death. If each moment lived forever, it would not be a unique moment in time. If all people lived forever, they would lose their uniqueness as well. Ironically, it is death that provides our significance as individuals.<br />
Sukkot, the festival of death, is the culmination of a month, Tishrei, which provides each of us with distinctness in a transient world created solely for the purpose of providing individual significance.<br />
As we approach the cold winter months, the harvest festival of Sukkot reveals that, to appreciate life, we should not fear death but savor the opportunity only a world that will eventually die can offer us. Carry this lesson with you, and you will relish life, and find true happiness always.</p>

<div><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: windowtext;"> </span></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: windowtext;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: windowtext;">Keeping Jewish Heritage Alive in Center City </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: windowtext;">By Cristina Hanganu-Bresch</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt; text-indent: 0.5in; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: windowtext;">….While film festivals and art exhibitions may hold a broader appeal for Jewish as well as non-Jewish audiences, religious services in synagogues face more complex challenges in trying to attract and retain the young and encourage them to practice Judaism as a way of life. Center City alone is home to over seven synagogues including Rittenhouse Square’s own Beth Zion (300 S 18th St.), Leyv Ha-Ir (1906 S. Rittenhouse Square), and the relative newcomer Mekor Habracha, (127 S. 22<sup>nd</sup> Street). </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt; text-indent: 0.5in; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: windowtext;">We had a chance to sit with Rabbi Eli Hirsch of Mekor Habracha<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>– a synagogue initiated in 1999 through the outreach efforts of the Etz Chaim Center for Jewish Studies. Eli (pronounced ELLIE) attempts to address the issue of keeping Judaism attractive to the younger generations by taking a laid-back, convivial approach to services. The Rabbi describes the new synagogue at 127 S. 22<sup>nd</sup> Street as being formed of more casual people, who come there to socialize as well as learn. For this younger crowd (which constitutes 70% of its members), he has devised a “user-friendly” service in which he explains the Torah in a down-to-earth manner, and moreover, how to apply those teachings in real life. It’s Torah for the new millennium, for the hip crowd—Judaism made relevant to a group of people who yearn precisely for that kind of energetic and sensible approach. And, at Mekor Habracha, one has the advantage of speaking one on one with the rabbi and other congregates at informal gatherings or “kiddush”—literally the blessing of the wine. For this occasion, Rabbi Hirsch presents his own delicious <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">cholent</em> (a hot vegetarian stew)—a sure hit, the Rabbi assures us with his broad, contagious grin.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt; text-indent: 0.5in; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: windowtext;">Mekor Habracha had a tentative early start (the first rabbi left in 2001) and a number of years of infrequent meetings at the Etz Chaim center. The congregation hired Rabbi Hirsch in March 2006 and since then its small community has grown and its outreach programs have expanded considerably.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>Eli has an infectious passion when he talks about his work in the new synagogue; it soon becomes clear that that fire comes from the kind of unwavering faith and passion that can inspire crowds and move mountains. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: windowtext;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;"> </span>The Rabbi’s talents do not stop at cooking. His role as a spiritual guide is a comprehensive, 24/7 job; to that end, he holds Saturday classes on the teachings of the Torah and an “Executive Study Program,” which offers one-on-one individualized study of Talmudic wisdom that can apply to all aspects of one’s life—including the search for meaningful relationships. Hirsch also holds relationship seminars and is partnered with </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: windowtext; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; mso-hansi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">a matchmaking service </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: windowtext;">because he believes that in the areas of love, commitment, and partnership, the Torah can be of particular help.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: windowtext;"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: windowtext;">For Rabbi Hirsch, Judaism is all about living a just and good life according to the principles of the Torah, and the Rabbi is helping young people navigate those principles with flair, aplomb, humor, and common sense. Ultimately, Rabbi Hirsch is trying to instill in the members of his synagogue the values of Judaism as an organic way of life, rather than as an occasional religious practice. And what’s in store for the (observant) Jewish community for the month of Elul? Perhaps it could be best described in Rabbi’s words: rediscovering what one’s own life is about. Judaism asks, in Rabbi’s opinion, what life is and concludes that it is first and foremost a question of <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">being</em> and <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">identity</em>, rather than one of doing and action. To Rabbi Hirsch’s regret, Americans still favor the question relating to action (what one should do) over the question related to being (who one should be), neglecting perhaps to acknowledge the importance of introspection and self-awareness. “According to the Torah,” says Rabbi Eli Hirsch, “life is about the process of self-actualization that connects a person to the ultimate truth, and helps that person become the human being he or she was meant to be.” He professes that once a person lives in the truth, he or she stops being afraid, and that is the ultimate freedom and our boon for living on earth. For all those observing Elul, but not only, here’s to hoping that they may achieve that kind of clarity. Also: K&#8217;tiva V&#8217;Hatima Tova!</span></p>

					<p>We write to you with great enthusiasm regarding the future of our community. Over the last two years, our minyan has experienced tremendous growth and welcomed many new participants. This expansion has translated into a vibrant congregation of which we can be proud. The next step of our development is now complete, as we are thrilled to announce that we have just signed a lease on a space to house our synagogue, located at 127 S. 22nd Street, between Walnut and Sansom.</p>
<p>Our new sitation is an exciting one, as it opens the possibility of becoming a fully functioning, independent synagogue. On the other hand, simply maintaining our status quo will require a significant increase in the operating budget.</p>
<p>Fundraising efforts have gotten off to a good start, and we are fortunate to have many wonderful individuals working hard to help us achieve our goals. For us to survive and thrive, it is vital that we increase these efforts. While we are pursuing funding sources outside our group (e.g. grants, individual donors), if our project is to be taken seriously, it is also necessary to maximize resources and participation from within the community. Until now we have not had a formal membership policy, but this is a logical place to start as we begin to build for the future.</p>
<p>We are, therefore, requesting that you become a member of our synagogue, Mekor Habracha/Center City Synagogue, by completing the attached form. If you have not yet made a pledge, inclusive of dues, please send the appropriate amount to our treasurer, Ellen B. Geller, 768 North Croskey Street, Philadelphia, PA 19130. You can also pay dues and make contributions online at: <a title="Make A Donation" href="https://networkforgood.org/donation/MakeDonation.aspx?ORGID2=743159417" target="_blank">https://networkforgood.org</a></p>
<p>If you are unable to pay the requested membership dues at this time, please fill out the application and remit any amount you can afford. If you can donate additional funds beyond the nominal membership fee, we greatly appreciate your generosity.</p>
<p>We look forward to working together to realize our shared vision.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
Bruce Taubman, President<br />
Rabbi Eliezer Hirsch</p>
