				<p>When People Leave Before the Memorial<br />
Prayer, What Message Are We Sending<br />
to Mourners?<br />
Sharrona Pearl Oct 1, 2015<br />
It doesn’t hurt me anymore.<br />
Standing quietly as I prepare for Yizkor, the memorial prayer, I watch most of the synagogue file out<br />
(quietly, respectfully—until they pass the invisible barrier and then, of course, there’s laughter, chatter,<br />
and why not?). It doesn’t hurt me anymore. I’m used to it. I’ve been witnessing this peculiar and almost<br />
ritualized procession for over 25 years, since I first started ducking out of junior congregation services to<br />
join the big shul for Yizkor. I expect it.<br />
But I still hate it.<br />

I hate that we do this to our mourners. I hate that we, as a community, who are usually so good at<br />
comfort and taking care of each other and really, have both the death ritual thing and the historical<br />
memory thing down pat, continue to have this giant blind spot when it comes to standing by those who<br />
are remembering loss. Some of us are veterans in the Yizkor ritual, but for others the wounds are fresh,<br />
giant, and gaping. For others, this first or second or third or 30th Yizkor is painful, and terrifying, and<br />
heart­wrenching.<br />
And what do we do for those people, those members of our community whom we’ve been standing<br />
beside in prayer for moments and hours during Yom Kippur, and Shemini Atzeret, and Passover, and<br />
Shavuot? What do we do to support them as they publicly revisit their loss, itself an act of courage and<br />
Jewish commitment?<br />
We leave.<br />
We get up, we walk past them, and we leave.<br />
In many communities, particularly those filled mostly with younger people, the mass exodus leaves<br />
behind just a scant few, standing solitary and standing out in once heavily­populated rows. We say to<br />
them: You have lost, and you have been made to feel lonely. And we will leave you lonely again. And we<br />
do.<br />
Look, I understand that many families have the strong tradition of honoring two living parents by leaving<br />
during Yizkor. I understand there is a powerful superstition for some about staying inside when no one<br />
near to them has died, a tremendously lucky situation that ought to be defended in every way. I get it. I<br />
respect it. If that is a custom that has existed in a given family across time and space, that may well<br />
supersede the recapitulation of loss that leaving engenders.<br />
READ: Mayim Bialik: Navigating Life as a Mourner<br />
But not everyone who leaves has that strong tradition. And for those who don’t, I think we ought to pay a<br />
little more attention to what, and whom, we are leaving behind when we exit. There are the people in the<br />
room, alone with their memories, perhaps, but, as we should remind them, not alone in their Jewish<br />
community. Never entirely alone. And there are the people in the Yizkor prayer itself, the historical<br />
Jewish martyrs, the Holocaust victims, the soldiers who have died in our defense. When we leave, we<br />
leave them, too. We say they are not ours to memorialize.<br />
But they are. Because community means support for those around us, and support for those who came<br />
before.<br />
I know that some synagogues (including my own) have the more recent tradition of inviting the<br />
congregation back for the communal memorial prayers, and still others have followed the lead of the<br />
United Synagogue for Conservative Judaism in recommending strongly that people remain inside. And<br />
these are, I think, the right recommendations. These are helping.<br />
But I still see the people file out at the end of the sermon (as Yizkor always is), desperate for a chat and<br />
a quick break, desperate to get out before the service begins, desperate to leave. I watch, and I turn to<br />
my siddur and my memories, and I move on. But as I remember my father, my grandparents, and others<br />
I have lost, I also remember myself, so many years ago. I remember what it felt like then to have<br />
everyone walk outside. And I remember that it felt like they were walking away from me.<br />
READ: Taking My Kids to the Cemetery<br />
There is another Yizkor service coming up soon, during Shemini Atzeret. Another chance for us to visit<br />
our individual and communal memories. Another chance to build new ones. And I urge us all to pause as<br />
we prepare to file out, pause for just a moment and think about whom we are leaving behind, and what<br />
kind of memory that might create. And maybe, instead of leaving, we stay. Instead of walking away from<br />
our mourners in their moments of vulnerability, we stand with them.<br />
