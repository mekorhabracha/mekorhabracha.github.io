					<p>Think Again: Why we weep for Rabbi Nosson Tzvi Finkel<br />
11/25/2011 16:21   By JONATHAN ROSENBLUM<br />
<a href="http://www.jpost.com/Magazine/Judaism/Article.aspx?id=246827">http://www.jpost.com/Magazine/Judaism/Article.aspx?id=246827</a></p>
<p>If you want to understand a person or a community, observe what he or they honor:</p>
<p>On the yahrzeit of our foremother Rachel, as I prepared to leave for the funeral of Rav Nosson Tzvi Finkel, of blessed memory, I received a call from a reporter from Sydney.</p>
<p>She wanted to discuss the antics of the zealots in Ramat Beit Shemesh. The next day Sky News called to discuss sexually segregated buses.</p>
<p>I told both reporters the same thing: Stop wasting your time on fringe groups and trivial issues. If you want to understand the haredi community, first find out why over 100,000 people attended the funeral of Rav Nosson Tzvi Finkel, with tens of thousands of adults sobbing openly and unashamedly. If you want to understand a person or a community, observe what he or they honor: “[A] person [reveals himself] according to what he praises” (Proverbs 26:21).</p>
<p>Who was the remarkable man whose passing inspired such grief? When Rabbi Finkel took over the reins of Mir Yeshiva from his father-in-law, Rabbi Beinish Finkel, in 1990, he had already been diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease.</p>
<p>Many wondered how he could carry the burden, yet under his leadership the 1,000-student yeshiva expanded rapidly. New buildings were built; another branch was started in Kiryat Sefer. One yeshiva head quipped that Rav Nosson Tzvi might as well put a roof over the entire Beit Yisrael neighborhood (adjacent to Mea She’arim) and call it Mir Yeshiva. Today, 6,000 students learn in Mir Yeshiva’s many study halls, making it the largest yeshiva since the completion of the Talmud, perhaps the largest ever.</p>
<p>“Even when I lie down, I can’t rest because of the trembling,” he told one of his brothers-in-law, “so I think of ways to spread Torah.” Our Sages say that the Ark carried those who carried it. And so it was with Rav Nosson Tzvi.</p>
<p>After one long flight to Los Angeles, a crying stewardess told those who came to the airport to meet him, “Promise me you’ll never let him do this again. How could you do this to this holy man?” When people accused his brothers-in-law of “shlepping him” on grueling trips, they replied, “We don’t shlep him, he shleps us.”</p>
<p>He used his debilitating disease to build more Torah and to teach. A rich businessman refused his request for a large donation. “I can’t,” he said. The rosh yeshiva told him, “I can’t either, but I do anyway.” He received the donation.</p>
<p>Howard Schultz, the founder of Starbucks, was once was brought to see the rosh yeshiva along with a group of prominent businessman. They had not been told of his Parkinson’s, and instinctively averted their eyes when he entered the room. Soon they heard a bang on the table and Rav Nosson Tzvi commanded them, “Look at me.</p>
<p>“I know you are all busy men,” he continued, “so I’ll be brief. What is the most important lesson of the Holocaust?” He proceeded to describe the situation of the Jews arriving in Auschwitz and other death camps, after having been packed into cattle cars for days, without water or facilities of any kind, and then being separated from their loved ones. When the lucky ones reached a barracks, they were given one blanket for six people. They could choose to share it or each one could try to grab it for himself.</p>
<p>They chose the former. “The greatest lesson of the Holocaust,” he concluded, “is the triumph of the human spirit. Now, each of you return to America and share your blanket with five others.”</p>
<p>Someone once asked him for advice on how to learn Torah even amidst afflictions. Rav Nosson Tzvi told him that he didn’t know. “I learn with great simha (joy),” he said. He refused to take the strongest medicines to control his disease for fear they would cloud his mind or rob him of his memory. When he mounted the dais in the Mir Yeshiva to give a lecture in the main study hall, he had to hold fast to two podiums to remain upright and he never knew whether he would be able to control his tongue sufficiently to speak. Once a violent tremor threw him from the couch, on which he lay prone, onto the floor while in the middle of learning with a student.</p>
<p>Even before he was helped up, he was asking his study partner to repeat the interpretation he had been offering.</p>
<p>Just as one would not begrudge the money spent to ransom a loved one, he viewed his ordeals as trivial price to pay for teaching and learning Torah, and not as selfsacrifice.</p>
<p>Everywhere he went, people of all ages rushed to be within four cubits of him and witness a soul that had so transcended the limits of the imperfect vessel of his body.</p>
<p>OUR SAGES give several possible explanations for the tests with which a tzaddik (righteous person) is afflicted.</p>
<p>Sometimes those tests serve to actualize his potential; sometimes to publicize his greatness. I will never forget the first time I saw Rav Nosson Tzvi, over 30 years ago, at the wedding of a former student. I had no idea who he was, but I could not take my eyes off of him. A Mona Lisa smile did not leave his lips the entire time I watched. It conveyed goodness and love and elation in a student’s joyous occasion. I asked someone, “Who is that man who looks like an angel?” The special qualities were already there.</p>
<p>With love, he inspired thousands of young men to reach heights they had never dreamed possible. In the Mir Yeshiva, under Rav Nosson Tzvi, it did not matter where you were from, your family connections, or how high your IQ. Rav Nosson Tzvi was prepared to help each student reach his potential. He never forgot that he had arrived at the Mir Yeshiva, lanky teenaged Nattie from a coed Jewish high school in Chicago, wearing a Cubs hat (though, he quipped, the golf clubs were left behind).</p>
<p>From his days as a young newlywed until he was felled by a sudden heart attack, he made it a practice to establish study sessions with any student who requested one.</p>
<p>A rosh yeshiva several decades Rav Nosson Tzvi’s senior once came to visit him. Despite Rav Nosson Tzvi’s protests, the older scholar insisted it was incumbent upon him to visit someone who knew 3,000 students by name. “I’m not sure if I know each one by name,” Rav Nosson Tzvi said, “but I love each one.” All those who entered the Mir found out that this was true.</p>
<p>A ba’al teshuva (returnee to religious observance) recently arrived at the Mir from the Ohr Somayach Yeshiva could not find the special penitential prayers in an unfamiliar prayer book. His humiliation was rising by the second, until Rav Nosson Tzvi, who had somehow noticed his discomfiture, came rushing over with a prayer book open to the correct page. Such stories are legion: Rav Nosson Tzvi checking on students in their sealed rooms during the Gulf War; Rav Nosson Tzvi personally taking a student who fainted in class to a doctor and then insisting that he move into the crowded Finkel home; Rav Nosson Tzvi accompanying a student who was about to be married in his search for an apartment; Rav Nosson Tzvi, just back from a fund-raising trip abroad, crying at the beginning of his Friday Torah class because “I missed you all so much.”</p>
<p>Those who had been sure the rosh yeshiva would not remember them from years before in the yeshiva were astonished to be greeted as “My Chaim,” in a long receiving line, or to be reminded of a difficulty they had posed to the rosh yeshiva a decade earlier. Some sought to avoid imposing on the rosh yeshiva to officiate at their weddings, which entailed him arriving in a wheelchair and being assisted by at least two others to the huppa. To no avail. Inevitably they would receive a call in the middle of wedding that the rosh yeshiva was outside and wanted to wish the new couple “mazel tov.” A former student from America begged the rosh yeshiva not to attend his son’s bar mitzvah at the Western Wall. “I missed your chasanah [wedding] 15 years ago; I’m not missing the bar mitzva,” Rav Nosson Tzvi told him.</p>
<p>“Not a blade of grass grows unless an angel strikes it and says, ‘Grow,’” our Sages teach. Rav Nosson Tzvi was that angel for tens of thousands of students and dozens of promising young scholars whom he appointed to give classes in Mir Yeshiva. The image of the rosh yeshiva learning in a freezing cold room to be able to meet his daily quota of learning inspired. But above all it was his smile, the way he grasped your hand in both of his, that will leave a lasting impression.</p>
<p>Mendy entered the Mir Yeshiva after an indifferent career in other yeshivot. But the rosh yeshiva was always ready to provide another chance. Toward the end of a long five-month semester, the rosh yeshiva announced that he would like the unmarried students to commit to learning 12 hours a day, without any breaks. It never occurred to Mendy that the rosh yeshiva could have meant him. A few days later, the rosh yeshiva approached Mendy and asked why his name was not on the sign-up list.</p>
<p>Mendy could not believe the absence of his name had been noticed among hundreds of names. But when he saw that the rosh yeshiva was serious, he signed up. The first days were very difficult. But after dropping into bed exhausted on the third night of the new regime, Mendy found himself dreaming about the Talmud in his sleep.</p>
<p>The next morning he told the rosh yeshiva what had happened. Rav Nosson Tzvi spontaneously began to dance with him in the study hall.</p>
<p>Now you know why we are weeping.</p>

					<p>Jacob the Liar: Rabbi Hirsch on a troubling aspect of the current Torah reading &#8211; Philadelphia Jewish culture | Examiner.com </p>
<p><a href="http://www.examiner.com/jewish-culture-in-philadelphia/jacob-the-liar-rabbi-hirsch-on-a-troubling-aspect-of-the-current-torah-reading">http://www.examiner.com/jewish-culture-in-philadelphia/jacob-the-liar-rabbi-hirsch-on-a-troubling-aspect-of-the-current-torah-reading</a></p>
<p>Published Friday, November 25, 2011, 11:13 A.M. </p>
<p>A few years ago, I attended a special exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art featuring &#8220;The Gates of Paradise,&#8221; magnificent bronze doors on loan from the Baptistery in Florence, fashioned by the renowned Italian sculptor Lorenzo Ghiberti. The doors depict images of ten famous scenes from the Bible, from Adam and Eve to Solomon and Sheba. Next to me stood two women, one of whom was not familiar with the stories behind the artwork. When she heard the infamous story of Rebecca and Jacob&#8217;s conspiracy to steal Isaac&#8217;s blessings, the listener was aghast, exclaiming in sincere shock, &#8220;how is it that we name our children Rebecca and Jacob after such evil people?!&#8221; In another unflattering reading of the story, celebrity radio minister Fulton Sheen would inspire his listeners by declaring, &#8220;If a thief and liar like Jacob could become chosen by G-d, anyone can!&#8221; Such criticism of this seminal event and of Jacob in particular, is extremely problematic. After all, Jacob is eventually named &#8220;Israel&#8221;, equated with perfection(1) and considered the epitome of the human evolution that began with Adam(2). Any condemnation of Jacob is essentially a condemnation of the Jewish people which would evolve from and be named for him. Why then would God have the Jewish nation emanate from such a morally ambiguous act?</p>
<p>Even more confusing are Isaac&#8217;s decisions that prompted Jacob&#8217;s deceit. Our tradition teaches that Jacob was the personification of truth and goodness(3) while his elder twin brother Esav, the intended recipient of Isaac&#8217;s blessings, was deemed the root of evil(4). There are several indications that Isaac knew about Esav&#8217;s ungodly nature(5). The question one must ask is how Isaac could make the colossal mistake of nearly handing the mantle of the Jewish nation to Esav in the first place.<br />
The truth is, Isaac had no reason to believe that one of his children would advance Abraham’s dynasty to the exclusion of the other. The logical assumption was that the rogue Esav and the timid Jacob would enter a partnership, each contributing their strength to the development of the nation(6). Esav would manage the physical aspect of nationhood, including organizing the military; building national infrastructure and government; and creating agricultural and economic viability(7). Jacob, on the other hand, would lead the spiritual aspect, dedicating his life to Torah study, prayer, and Godliness(8). Isaac&#8217;s bifurcated blessings to each of his sons clearly express this vision. Whereas Esav&#8217;s blessings were almost entirely related to the material world(9), Jacob&#8217;s &#8220;Blessing of Abraham&#8221;(10) focused on the continuity of God’s sacred relationship with Abraham’s progeny. Isaac&#8217;s vision of complementary leaders also illustrates his defining trait of &#8220;Din&#8221; or strict justice, which acts as an instrument of categorization and definition, resolving concepts into their individual components(11).</p>
<p>In complete opposition to Isaac&#8217;s picturing of a nation led by separate powers, it was Rebecca who understood that a nation on a spiritual mission could not succeed in a fragmented state. For Jacob and for Israel to survive as God&#8217;s nation, she claimed it was imperative that the physical inheritance not be divorced from the spiritual one&#8211;that splitting these two essential elements would mean damaging the very foundation from which the nation was formed. </p>
<p>It is easier to understand Rebecca&#8217;s position if we first examine the way Torah defines the interrelationship between physical and spiritual. Essentially, we are told that the purpose of God&#8217;s creation of a physical universe was to provide space for human existence (in Kabbalistic terminology, tzimtzum). Without the physical, there would be God&#8217;s presence alone, leaving no room for our existence(12). As a result, to devalue the physical is to devalue our own existence and impair any ability to connect with God, for only when we possess our own distinct physical existence can we fully connect to spirituality, another word for Godliness. We are taught that in the ultimate human state, soul and body are fully combined, since without the physical body a soul is in an imperfect transitory state(13).</p>
<p>Throughout history, humanity has struggled to explain the apparent dichotomy between &#8220;physical&#8221; and “spiritual.&#8221; Some say the physical universe is all there is, while others vilify it as an obstruction to attaining a true spiritual self. Once we understand that meaningful reality only exists within a synthesis of physical and spiritual, we can shed this painful conflict that forces humanity to remain inevitably torn. The physical is, therefore, not inherently evil or profane; nor is it simply a vessel, or a means to a holy end. The physical grants each of us our unique space so that spirituality can be transformed from the realm of the universal to the realm of the individual. In other words, though God exists beyond the physical, we as spiritual beings cannot exist without the physical providing space for that existence(14).</p>
<p>Rebecca thus implored Jacob to prepare food, representative of the physical realm, and to aggressively appear as Esav&#8217;s clone, to prove that the physical and the spiritual can and must be unified. Consequently, Jacob&#8217;s declaration of &#8220;I am Esav, your firstborn son&#8221; involved none of the denial of a classic lie*15). It was an unapologetic assertion to his father that he could connect to the physical world on the level of Esav, and that these powers should not be segregated(16). Indeed, Isaac sensed Jacob&#8217;s connection to the Garden of Eden(17) where physical and spiritual were once integrated at the highest level. That is why, when Isaac realized what Jacob had done, he confirmed Jacob&#8217;s physical blessings instead of reacting with anger(18). Finally, this concept is eventually symbolized by Jacob&#8217;s ladder, which represents the necessary interrelationship of the realms of the heavens (spiritual) and the earth (physical) along an uninterrupted continuum(19).</p>
<p>Although our physical universe seems eternally polarized between good and evil, eternal and ephemeral, religious and secular; the Torah&#8217;s definition of holiness lies specifically in the successful integration of both the physical and the spiritual.  Societal and religious conventions sometimes convince us that the physical world is the antithesis to holiness; however, Rebecca and Jacob taught us that the objective is &#8220;Tiferet&#8221; or “synthesis”(20), where our physical and spiritual selves are intertwined in a single whole, each dependent on, and developing from, the other(21). Our jobs, our health, our physical desires, should not be viewed as an unfortunate consequence of life in a physical universe or even as a means to a spiritual end. Rather, our physical existence is the form that allows us to develop as unique spiritual beings. To deny the physical is to deny the very aspect in which the spiritual is manifest, and ultimately, our ability to attain holiness. </p>

					<p><em>Why Did God Ask Abraham To Sacrifice Isaac?<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>Published in the Philadelphia Examiner Wednesday, November 9, 2011, 11:08 AM <a href="http://www.examiner.com/jewish-culture-in-philadelphia/why-did-god-ask-abraham-to-sacrifice-isaac-rabbi-eliezer-hirsch-explains">http://www.examiner.com/jewish-culture-in-philadelphia/why-did-god-ask-abraham-to-sacrifice-isaac-rabbi-eliezer-hirsch-explains</a></em></p>
<p><em> </em>One of the most perplexing episodes in the Torah occurs in this week&#8217;s portion, Vayeira, when God calls upon Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac on an altar. Many have questioned the purpose of this request, and satisfactory answers seem elusive. Some posit that God wanted to test Abraham&#8217;s loyalty. Others trace martyrdom (and even suicide bombers) to this incident. Perhaps in frustration, still others suggest the command was arbitrary, imagined, or allegorical. In any case, our tradition relates that Abraham had already shown willingness to die for God. (Midrash Rabba Genesis 39:3, Rashi Avot 5:4). Was it necessary to yet again put Abraham&#8217;s loyalty to the test, particularly at Isaac&#8217;s expense?</p>
<p>Abraham&#8217;s great discovery was the concept of &#8220;Chesed&#8221; or loving-kindness (Zohar Genesis 146). He spread a message that resonated with tens of thousands of followers (Mishneh Torah, Avodat Kochavim 1:3): the existence of an infinite creator who desires to shower love and spiritual pleasure upon his creations. Abraham&#8217;s subsequent experiences with God&#8217;s tests forced him to confront a profound paradox: how could this loving, benevolent creator be reconciled with a cold world full of seemingly cruel &#8220;tests”? If only we could conceive of an approach to this challenging query, a &#8220;Unified Theological Theory&#8221; would be within reach.</p>
<p>We are told that &#8220;God tested Abraham ten times&#8221; (Avot 5:4). The truth is, these tests were meant to demonstrate that the purpose of life&#8217;s trials is not to weed out the disloyal, but rather to establish the fully developed identity of the individual. Without an awareness of independent, constantly evolving, selfhood, Abraham&#8217;s and God&#8217;s mutual goal of love and relationship is inconceivable. Mature relationship cannot be born out of coercion, nor can it be founded on dependency or emotional neediness. Genuine love is a choice made by two individuals who recognize the value of their own existence, and are therefore capable of relating to another without suffering a loss of self. Essentially, it is only such an independent identity, emerging from life&#8217;s tests, that can allow for healthy love and relationship to endure.</p>
<p>Of course, there is a fundamental contradiction to that critical independence—life itself is given to us. How can we attain selfhood if the very life in which we become ourselves is granted by God? Abraham had to face this very contradiction. He had earned much in his life; however, his son&#8217;s life and the nation it would generate were bestowed upon him as a gift from God. If &#8220;givens&#8221; create dependency, thereby damaging the possibility for mutual relationship and love, Abraham&#8217;s revelation regarding loving-kindness and the shared relationship between God and His creations becomes embroiled in an inevitable Catch-22.</p>
<p>There is one possible resolution to this quandary, all too familiar to those who have faced life-threatening situations. Individuals who have undergone a critical illness or survived a serious accident are most able to appreciate life, acutely cognizant of its significance after confronting death. In fact, in this state of awareness they are almost incapable of taking life for granted, always mindful of how precarious it really is. Because they don’t hold the common assumption that their existence “belongs” to them, they are free to create an identity unlimited by longing for a security they know they can never possess. Only then does life become a magnificent gift to be utilized, rather than a matter of ownership or dependency.</p>
<p>For Abraham to escape the potential bondage of everything given him, he needed to endure the most devastating experience of all, one that challenged everything he ever counted on. The Binding of Isaac showed Abraham that all he treasured could be seized from him in a single, insane instant, by none other than God Himself. It demonstrated once and for all that nothing, not God&#8217;s chosen nation, not even life itself, can be taken as a comfortable given.</p>
<p>Only after this test could both Abraham and Isaac live as true individualists, setting the foundation of the rest of their lives and of Jewish history with an understanding that those things that are given to us are not our own. Life may be allotted to us free of charge, but the story of the Binding of Isaac illustrates that, ironically, we can only fully become ourselves if we live as having narrowly eluded the clutches of death. Then, we can &#8220;let go&#8221; to the extent that we feel we have nothing to lose other than our own potential. Deep down, most of us can accept that the immense pleasure found in this kind of freedom, this authentic independence and opportunity for meaningful love, justifies life&#8217;s trials, and only a lesson this significant could warrant a command so extreme.</p>
<p>The Binding of Isaac is meant to create a paradigm shift in our outlook on life. Those things that are granted us, be they looks or abilities, are not our own and should not identify or define us. What we call &#8220;I” is only the result of developing all that was given to us. It is in understanding this subtle distinction that we become free of attitudes that hold us back from the crowning achievement of self-actualization, and that which can ultimately propel us to greatness and love.</p>
