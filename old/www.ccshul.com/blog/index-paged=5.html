					<p>To the Mekor Habracha Community,</p>
<p>The situation in Israel is dire. Hamas rocket attacks are bombarding the entire country from Gaza in unprecedented fashion. It is difficult for many of us in the US to helplessly watch this aggression perpetrated against our brethren and not know how to help.</p>
<p>Last night, at our annual shul member meeting, we recited prayers for the inhabitants of Israel and the soldiers of the IDF. I also shared an insight from the weekly Parsha emphasizing that we should be very concerned about the crisis, yet not become disabled because of worry; to stay productive, particularly in a Jewish sense, at this critical time. (For a re-recording, click here: http://www.ccshul.com/audio/14-360%20Intro%20to%20Shul%20Meeting%20%20-%20Vengeance%20.m4a</p>
<p>What else can we do? Here are some suggestions culled from various Jewish organizations:</p>
<p>1. Pray &#038; Study Torah: This is first and foremost, the Jewish way of dealing with crisis. (One well known source for this is Psalms 20: &#8220;Some trust in chariots, and some in horses, but [the Jewish People] call upon our God&#8221;.) There is a custom to recite Psalms in times of distress; Psalms 20, 83, 121,130 and 142 are generally recommended, but any Psalm can be recited. </p>
<p>Tradition teaches us that learning Torah is the most powerful spiritual tool we posses as Jews. </p>
<p>We will be reciting special prayers and extra Torah learning in shul over Shabbat as well. </p>
<p>2. Attend the Israel Solidarity Rally: Operation Protective Edge, tomorrow, Friday, July 11 at the SW corner of 19th &#038; JFK at 12 PM. https://www.facebook.com/events/720395424684245/</p>
<p>3. Contact your US Representatives &#038; Senators &#038; urge them to stand with Israel by issuing a public statement of support for Operation Protective Edge and Israel&#8217;s right to defend itself. http://advocacy.ou.org/action-alerts/?utm_source=SilverpopMailing&#038;utm_medium=email&#038;utm_campaign=Israel%20Emergency%20Campaign%200714%20-%20oua%20(1)&#038;utm_content=&#038;spMailingID=9622174&#038;spUserID=MjM4MTI2NTAwNzYS1&#038;spJobID=304190764&#038;spReportId=MzA0MTkwNzY0S0#/19</p>
<p>4. Many Israeli charitable organizations are stepping in to provide assistance with essential items for displaced Israelis, care for the elderly, assistance to the IDF, etc. There are many worthy charities that are helping including:<br />
Yad Eliezer is sending thousands of gift packs to our soldiers near Gaza. http://www.yadeliezer.org/<br />
Yad Ezra v&#8217;Shulamit is sending tons of food to Israeli families being attacked by Hamas rockets. http://www.yadezra.net/index_e.php<br />
United With Israel is helping to build bomb shelters in Israeli communities under attack. http://unitedwithisrael.org/shelters/<br />
Thank Israeli Soldiers supports our troops by delivering your personal letter of thanks and a care package of items soldiers need. http://www.thankisraelisoldiers.org/<br />
Magen David Adom Israelâ€™s ambulance, blood-services, and disaster-relief organization. https://www.afmda.org/ways-to-give/make-a-donation/<br />
OU Israel Emergency Fund benefiting the citizens of Sderot, Kiryat Gat, Kiryat Malachi, Beit Shemesh and Ofakim. https://www.ou.org/israel-emergency/?utm_source=SilverpopMailing&#038;utm_medium=email&#038;utm_campaign=Israel%20Emergency%20Campaign%200714%20-%20oua%20(1)&#038;utm_content=&#038;spMailingID=9622174&#038;spUserID=MjM4MTI2NTAwNzYS1&#038;spJobID=304190764&#038;spReportId=MzA0MTkwNzY0S0</p>
<p>5. We can learn and share facts concerning the situation in Israel with friends and colleagues in conversation, email, Facebook etc., to combat the misinformation that is so prevalent in the media.  (For facts about the current situation, please see AIPAC&#8217;s memo here:<br />
 https://www.ou.org/israel-emergency/?utm_source=SilverpopMailing&#038;utm_medium=email&#038;utm_campaign=Israel%20Emergency%20Campaign%200714%20-%20oua%20(1)&#038;utm_content=&#038;spMailingID=9622174&#038;spUserID=MjM4MTI2NTAwNzYS1&#038;spJobID=304190764&#038;spReportId=MzA0MTkwNzY0S0</p>
<p>6. Follow the developments of the rocket fire (and the terror of our Israeli brethren) with the Red Alert Israel app: (click for iOS and Android)</p>
<p>May God protect Israel and our soldiers and bring a speedy, peaceful resolution to this crisis.</p>

					<p>Dear Friends,<br />
The Center City Jewish community has experienced tremendous growth in the last few years, both in number as well as in the quality of Jewish life. Part of this exciting development involves an effort to build a Mikvah (Jewish ritual bath) in the City. Jewish tradition states that a Mikvah is a vital element of a Jewish community, to the extent that it should be established before any other communal structure, even before a shul, a school, or an eruv. Thank God, Center City has shuls, schools and an eruv, but we do not yet have a Mikvah.<br />
Rabbi Menachem Schmidt Shlit&#8217;a has laid the foundation for a Mikvah in Center City by generously dedicating the Vilna shul building for the site of the Mikvah, saving the project hundreds of thousands of dollars and making the possibility of building a Mikvah in the near term much more likely.<br />
Local community leaders have been working with a wonderful organization called Mikvah USA, whose sole purpose is to assist American Jewish communities with their efforts to build a Mikvah in their particular community. In addition to giving planning assistance, Mikvah USA has connected our community with generous donors ready to make large donations which would cover much of the approximately $400,000 price tag.  However, we have recently been informed by Mikvah USA that these donors need to see serious support from the Center City community before committing to these pledges.  Mikvah USA has specifically asked the Mekor Habracha community to raise $50,000 towards the project, of which we have raised about $15,000 to date. Despite the significant pressure this poses on all of us, particularly difficult considering the tight time frame, we now have a real opportunity to bring this project to fruition. If we are not successful, it could take many years before we have this kind of opportunity again.<br />
Aliza Sadiky has graciously agreed to head our shul&#8217;s Mikvah committee to coordinate our efforts toward the Mikvah project. The committee will conduct an emergency meeting on Thursday, May 15 at 6:30 PM at the shul. Everyone in the community is welcome and encouraged to attend this meeting.<br />
Committee members will also be calling members of our community to ask for pledges. We appreciate your courtesy if you receive a call, even if you cannot make a pledge at this time.<br />
If you are able to help this important cause, you may do so by giving to the shul the same way we currently do, by check, via PayPal or via Network for Good with a memo indicating that you would like the funds to be sent to the Mikvah account. This information can be found here: http://www.ccshul.com/index.php?id=11. The shul will hold the money until the funding is confirmed. You can also donate directly to the Mikvah by following the instructions on the Mikvah website at http://philamikvah.org/. Pledges (which may be paid over two years) may be emailed to mekorhabracha@gmail.com.<br />
We sincerely hope that the Center City Mikvah will soon become a reality, and that we will witness the continued success of our wonderful community.<br />
Rabbi Eliezer Hirsch<br />
