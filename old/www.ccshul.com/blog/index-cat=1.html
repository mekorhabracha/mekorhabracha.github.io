<h2 class="title">Center City Kehillah Kicks Off New Monthly Learning Program</h2>
<div class="content"><span class="date-display-single">December 9, 2015</span></p>
<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden">
<div>Jews of all backgrounds are coming together to form a melting pot of students, teachers and ideas.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Center City Kehillah’s new learning series, called “Learning in Pairs: The Center City Kehillah’s New Jewish Learning Experience,” will take place once a month from December through June. The series is open to everyone, regardless of Jewish background or experience.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Miriam Steinberg-Egeth, director of Center City Kehillah — and the creator of the “Miriam’s Advice Well” blog at jewishexponent.com — said the program intends to bring people together, regardless of Jewish affiliation, so they can learn on whatever terms they feel comfortable with.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Center City Kehillah is in cooperation with and funded by the Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia.</div>
<div></div>
<div>“There are a lot of things in the Jewish community that we can’t do together across denominations; learning is one of the things we can do,” Steinberg-Egeth said.</div>
<div></div>
<div>She said the blend of denominations will aid the idea of chevruta, or paired, learning.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The first session of the series will begin on Dec. 16 with Rabbi Eli Freedman from Congregation Rodeph Shalom and Rabbi Eliezer Hirsch from Mekor Habracha. Their lecture will focus on a post-Chanukah discussion of how to fight.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Hirsch explained that they will discuss the positive elements of disagreeing, but also what is the right way to have disagreements and how to avoid the wrong ways.</div>
<div></div>
<div>He hopes participants will gain a new perspective within their pairs, which allows for a much more intimate conversation.</div>
<div></div>
<div>“It’s very important to learn in pairs,” Hirsch said. “There are many reasons why, in yeshiva, Jews learn this way. One of them is the fact that as opposed to learning by yourself, you have someone else as a sounding board. So when you study with somebody else, they’re able to catch any mistakes you make or able to have feedback about a piece of learning.”</div>
<div></div>
<div>“With any learning program, the hope is that you find the right format for people to be inspired to learn more,” Hirsch added.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Steinberg-Egeth wanted to create something that was both more open-ended chronologically and more accessible to as many people as possible.</div>
<div></div>
<div>“We don’t want to duplicate efforts,” she said. “We don’t want to do something that people are already doing and benefiting from. But what we can do is create a program with a set of teachers that crosses all of those organizational lines.”</div>
<div></div>
<div>The teachers for the program also vary across denominations.</div>
<div></div>
<div>“We invited rabbis and educators to partner up with another teacher in town and pick a topic,” she explained, “not only traditional Hebrew text-based learning that you sort of think of in those adult learning programs,” but also from current events, newspaper clippings or blogs, which “really opens up the definition of what Jewish learning can look like.”</div>
<div></div>
<div>Each class will center on a different topic, pairing teachers who are diverse but who also have expertise in those areas.</div>
<div></div>
<div>“The overarching theme is Jewish learning,” she laughed. “I think it is a real benefit because the topics are as diverse as the teachers and learners themselves.”</div>
<div></div>
<div>Learning in pairs is the way Jews have done it for centuries. Steinberg-Egeth wants to build on that experience for people who are already doing it and introduce others to that kind of learning experience, making the boundaries of denominations more fluid.</div>
<div></div>
<div>“The best way to learn is in conversation with someone else,” she said. “A traditional American library is a quiet place, and a Jewish beit midrash is a loud place. When you’re sitting across from someone reading a source out loud and then talking about it, you gain so much more perspective.”</div>
<div></div>
<div>Steinberg-Egeth expects around 30 people to attend the first session.</div>
<div></div>
<div>“I hope the participants will learn something new and have a really positive experience actively engaged with Jewish learning,” she said. “Wherever they find themselves positioned in the spectrum of Jewish experience, there are people at similar points to them, people at different points to them — but everyone can join together to do this kind of program.”</div>

					<p>A Missed Opportunity</p>
<p>On Sunday, October 25, the Center City Jewish community was privileged to celebrate a unique occasion: the Hachnasat Sefer Torah, the dedication of a beautiful new Torah donated to Congregation Mekor Habracha. A large crowd gathered in Rittenhouse Square, where we began our joyful procession. Although the Philadelphia NBC and FOX television stations sent reporters to cover this inspiring and colorful event, we were disappointed that the Jewish Exponent did not. This is the first time our shul has obtained a Sefer Torah of its own, and it is a tribute to our flourishing congregation. The entire Philadelphia Jewish community is enriched by a vibrant Jewish presence in Center City, and we hope that the Exponent will strengthen its commitment to sharing this type of local news with its readers.</p>

					<p>When People Leave Before the Memorial<br />
Prayer, What Message Are We Sending<br />
to Mourners?<br />
Sharrona Pearl Oct 1, 2015<br />
It doesn’t hurt me anymore.<br />
Standing quietly as I prepare for Yizkor, the memorial prayer, I watch most of the synagogue file out<br />
(quietly, respectfully—until they pass the invisible barrier and then, of course, there’s laughter, chatter,<br />
and why not?). It doesn’t hurt me anymore. I’m used to it. I’ve been witnessing this peculiar and almost<br />
ritualized procession for over 25 years, since I first started ducking out of junior congregation services to<br />
join the big shul for Yizkor. I expect it.<br />
But I still hate it.<br />
READ: My Son’s First Kippah is Making Me Rethink My Identity<br />
I hate that we do this to our mourners. I hate that we, as a community, who are usually so good at<br />
comfort and taking care of each other and really, have both the death ritual thing and the historical<br />
memory thing down pat, continue to have this giant blind spot when it comes to standing by those who<br />
are remembering loss. Some of us are veterans in the Yizkor ritual, but for others the wounds are fresh,<br />
giant, and gaping. For others, this first or second or third or 30th Yizkor is painful, and terrifying, and<br />
heart­wrenching.<br />
And what do we do for those people, those members of our community whom we’ve been standing<br />
beside in prayer for moments and hours during Yom Kippur, and Shemini Atzeret, and Passover, and<br />
Shavuot? What do we do to support them as they publicly revisit their loss, itself an act of courage and<br />
Jewish commitment?<br />
We leave.<br />
We get up, we walk past them, and we leave.<br />
In many communities, particularly those filled mostly with younger people, the mass exodus leaves<br />
behind just a scant few, standing solitary and standing out in once heavily­populated rows. We say to<br />
them: You have lost, and you have been made to feel lonely. And we will leave you lonely again. And we<br />
do.<br />
Look, I understand that many families have the strong tradition of honoring two living parents by leaving<br />
during Yizkor. I understand there is a powerful superstition for some about staying inside when no one<br />
near to them has died, a tremendously lucky situation that ought to be defended in every way. I get it. I<br />
respect it. If that is a custom that has existed in a given family across time and space, that may well<br />
supersede the recapitulation of loss that leaving engenders.<br />
READ: Mayim Bialik: Navigating Life as a Mourner<br />
But not everyone who leaves has that strong tradition. And for those who don’t, I think we ought to pay a<br />
little more attention to what, and whom, we are leaving behind when we exit. There are the people in the<br />
room, alone with their memories, perhaps, but, as we should remind them, not alone in their Jewish<br />
community. Never entirely alone. And there are the people in the Yizkor prayer itself, the historical<br />
Jewish martyrs, the Holocaust victims, the soldiers who have died in our defense. When we leave, we<br />
leave them, too. We say they are not ours to memorialize.<br />
But they are. Because community means support for those around us, and support for those who came<br />
before.<br />
I know that some synagogues (including my own) have the more recent tradition of inviting the<br />
congregation back for the communal memorial prayers, and still others have followed the lead of the<br />
United Synagogue for Conservative Judaism in recommending strongly that people remain inside. And<br />
these are, I think, the right recommendations. These are helping.<br />
But I still see the people file out at the end of the sermon (as Yizkor always is), desperate for a chat and<br />
a quick break, desperate to get out before the service begins, desperate to leave. I watch, and I turn to<br />
my siddur and my memories, and I move on. But as I remember my father, my grandparents, and others<br />
I have lost, I also remember myself, so many years ago. I remember what it felt like then to have<br />
everyone walk outside. And I remember that it felt like they were walking away from me.<br />
READ: Taking My Kids to the Cemetery<br />
There is another Yizkor service coming up soon, during Shemini Atzeret. Another chance for us to visit<br />
our individual and communal memories. Another chance to build new ones. And I urge us all to pause as<br />
we prepare to file out, pause for just a moment and think about whom we are leaving behind, and what<br />
kind of memory that might create. And maybe, instead of leaving, we stay. Instead of walking away from<br />
our mourners in their moments of vulnerability, we stand with them.<br />
