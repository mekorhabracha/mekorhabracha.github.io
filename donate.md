##Mekor's First Sefer Torah
We are excited to announce that, for the first time, our congregation has obtained a Sefer Torah of its own. Claire Raab and Jordan Goldhammer have generously sponsored our Torah in honor of Claire's grandparents, and a Hachnasat Sefer Torah dedication ceremony will be made in their honor once the Torah is ready to be used, which will be soon! 

For a limited time, the Mekor Habracha family will have an opportunity to share in this important mitzvah of the acquisition of a Sefer Torah by dedicating portions of the Torah in honor of or in memory of loved ones. The following dedication opportunities are the only ones still available:

- High Holiday Torah cover for 2nd Torah: $1,000
- Special parshiot (e.g. Shema, Ten Commandments, etc): $250 each (several have been sponsored already)
- Sidra: $180 each (several have been sponsored already)
- Pasuk: $18 each
- Letter: $5 each

Original artwork highlighting the dedications will be prominently displayed in the shul. May our new Sefer Torah bring much blessing to our wonderful community!
