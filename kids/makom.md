# Makom Community

Mekor Habracha welcomes Makom Community back for its first complete year at the shul! 

Makom Community is a Jewish Enrichment Center for children ages 4–11 and their families. The center currently has 10 students, and is still open for enrollment. For the 2015–2016 school year, Makom Community is enrolling students in Pre-K through 5th grade. Please contact [Beverly Socher-Lerner](beverly@makomcommunity.org) if you are interested or have any questions. 

- Afterschool enrichment runs Monday through Friday 3-6pm. 
- Each week concludes with a joyful Family Shabbat Celebration at 5:30pm --- grandparents and siblings are most welcome! 
- Makom also provides full-day camp programming when schools are closed and parents need to be at work.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Makom Community needs to maintain a high level of security for its students. If you would like to enter Mekor Habracha from 2pm to 6pm between Mondays and Thursdays for a purpose other than a quick drop off of items for the shul, please do not enter without first contacting Beverly.
