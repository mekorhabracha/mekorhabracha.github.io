#Join Our Synagogue

Our members benefit from being part of an enthusiastic and social community, with the opportunity to get involved in services, shul events and programs. In addition to attending High Holiday services free of charge, members are listed in and have access to the shul directory. They also receive discounts throughout the year on shul-related offerings such as community meals and programs, kiddush and other sponsorships, and synagogue space for special occasions.

No one will be turned away for any reason. If you are unable to pay the full membership fee, we will work with you to make accommodations that will fit your budget. 

Membership dues: 

- Students: $200/year
- Singles: $375/year
- Couples/families: $700/year
